* List of things to be done for GCC

** Documentation bugs

-fallow-single-precision appears in the summary for C options, but appears to
 be obsolete.

-traditional has to be used with -E

Why language specific warnings in summary sections for the language?

GCC will silent accept any flag '-Wno...'

The following warnings do not appear in the summary:
-Wc++0x-compat

* List of things to be done for LLVM

The following should be marked as MIPS only:
- -mfpxx
- -mno-odd-spreg/-modd-spreg

The following should be marked as ARM only
- -mglobal-merge/-mno-global-merge
- -mlong-calls/-mno-long-calls

Listed by --help-hidden but not used:
- -fallow-single-precision dummy.c
- -omptargets=i686-pc-linux-gnu dummy.c

- --verify-debug-info

-include expects a pre-compiled header file

How to pass a C++ standard library to -stdlib=

-fsanitize-trap=cfi-cast-strict is not recognized, although
 -fno-sanitize=cfi-cast-strict is OK

-fsanitize-trap=vptr/-fno-sanitize-trap=vptr are unrecognized, even though
 vptr is one of the categories for the undefined sanitizer.

    $ clang++ -fsanitize-trap=vptr -fsanitize=undefined dummy.cpp
    clang-3.9: error: unsupported argument 'vptr' to option '-fsanitize-trap'
