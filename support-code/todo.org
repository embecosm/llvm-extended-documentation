* List of things to be done for GCC

-fallow-single-precision appears in the summary for C options, but appears to
 be obsolete.

-traditional has to be used with -E

Why language specific warnings in summary sections for the language?

-pedantic not in summary

-Wplacement-new is the default, so need -Wno-placement-new as entry

GCC will silent accept any flag '-Wno...'

The following warnings do not appear in the summary:
-Wc++0x-compat
-Wimport
-Wmissing-noreturn
-Wstrict-overflow=0
-Wsynth
-Wunreachable-code
-Wunused-argument

-fvar-tracking-assignments-toggle is not in Debugging Options summary

-ftree-coalesce-inlined-vars undocumented in GCC
-ftree-copyrename undocumented

-fwpa only in option summary, not documented.

-nostdinc++ also appears in C++ standard options as well as preproc

-trigraphs also appears in C standard options as well as preproc

-iquote not in summary for preprocesso
