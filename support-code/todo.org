* List of things to be done for GCC

-fallow-single-precision appears in the summary for C options, but appears to
 be obsolete.

-traditional has to be used with -E

Why language specific warnings in summary sections for the language?

-pedantic not in summary

-Wplacement-new is the default, so need -Wno-placement-new as entry

GCC will silent accept any flag '-Wno...'

The following warnings do not appear in the summary:
-Wc++0x-compat
-Wimport
-Wmissing-noreturn
-Wstrict-overflow=0
-Wsynth
-Wunreachable-code
-Wunused-argument

-ftree-coalesce-inlined-vars undocumented in GCC
-ftree-copyrename undocumented

-fwpa only in option summary, not documented.

-nostdinc++ also appears in C++ standard options as well as preproc

-trigraphs also appears in C standard options as well as preproc

-iquote not in summary for preprocesso

-fsel-sched-verbose in summary only

-fsel-sched-dump-cfg in summary only

-fsel-sched-pipelining-verbose in summary only

The following are not mentioned in the summary for the pre-processor:
-fdirectives-only
-fdollars-in-identifiers
-fno-show-column
-fexec-charset=
-fextended-identifiers
-finput-charset=
-fpch-deps
-fpch-preprocess
-fpreprocessed
-ftabstop=
-fwide-exec-charset=UTF-8
-MD
-MMD

Preprocessor option -version (with one hyphen appears not to work).

The following are not mentioned in the summary for C++ language options:
-fextern-tls-init
-fno-lifetime-dse
-fno-use-cxa-get-exception-ptr

The following is mentioned neither in the summary nor section on C++ language
options, but does appear elsewhere:
-fno-default-inline


The following are not mentioned in the summary for optimization:
-foptimize-strlen
-ftree-slp-vectorize
-ftree-vectorize

The following optimization parameters are documented, but appear not to work.
--param tracer-min-branch-ratio-feedback=
--param reorder-blocks-duplicate=
--param reorder-blocks-duplicate-feedback=
--param sched-spec-state-edge-prob-cutoff=
--param selsched-max-insns-to-rename=
--param lto-minpartition=
--param max-ssa-name-query-depth=

The following are not mentioned in the summary for debugging:
-fvar-tracking-assignments-toggle
-ggnu-pubnames
-gpubnames
-gsplit-dwarf

The following is not documented in the developer options
-print-multiarch
-freport-bug

The following developer options are documented, but appear not to work.
-fdump-rtl-bypass
-fdump-rtl-dce
-fdump-rtl-dce1
-fdump-rtl-dce2
-fdump-rtl-eh
-fdump-rtl-gcse1
-fdump-rtl-initvals
-fdump-rtl-regclass
-fdump-rtl-seqabstr
-fdump-rtl-sibling
-fdump-rtl-subregs_of_mode_finish
-fdump-rtl-subregs_of_mode_init
-fdump-rtl-unshare
-fdump-tree-storeccp

-fcheck-data-deps is not documented. From the patch documentation, this
 compares the results of several data dependence analyzers, and probably
 belongs in the instrumentation section.
