@c @smallbook
@c @set SMALL
@c WARE! Some of the machine-dependent sections contain tables of machine
@c instructions.  Except in multi-column format, these tables look silly.
@c Unfortunately, Texinfo doesn't have a general-purpose multi-col format, so
@c the multi-col format is faked within @example sections.
@c
@c Again unfortunately, the natural size that fits on a page, for these tables,
@c is different depending on whether or not smallbook is turned on.
@c This matters, because of order: text flow switches columns at each page
@c break.
@c
@c The format faked in this source works reasonably well for smallbook,
@c not well for the default large-page format.  This manual expects that if you
@c turn on @smallbook, you will also uncomment the "@set SMALL" to enable the
@c tables in question.  You can turn on one without the other at your
@c discretion, of course.
@ifinfo
@set SMALL
@c the insn tables look just as silly in info files regardless of smallbook,
@c might as well show 'em anyways.

@node Manual
@section Structure of this Manual

@cindex manual, structure and purpose
This manual is intended to describe what you need to know to use the LLVM
integrated assembler.  We cover the syntax expected in source files, including
notation for symbols, constants, and expressions; the directives that the
assembler understands; and of course how to invoke the assembler.

This manual also describes some of the machine-dependent features of
various flavors of the assembler.

@cindex machine instructions (not covered)
On the other hand, this manual is @emph{not} intended as an introduction to
programming in assembly language---let alone programming in general!  In a
similar vein, we make no attempt to introduce the machine architecture; we do
@emph{not} describe the instruction set, standard mnemonics, registers or
addressing modes that are standard to a particular architecture.  You may want
to consult the manufacturer's machine architecture manual for this information.

@c I think this is premature---doc@cygnus.com, 17jan1991
@ignore
Throughout this manual, we assume that you are running @dfn{GNU},
the portable operating system from the @dfn{Free Software
Foundation, Inc.}.  This restricts our attention to certain kinds of
computer (in particular, the kinds of computers that @sc{gnu} can run on);
once this assumption is granted examples and definitions need less
qualification.

@command{@value{AS}} is part of a team of programs that turn a high-level
human-readable series of instructions into a low-level
computer-readable series of instructions.  Different versions of
@command{@value{AS}} are used for different kinds of computer.
@end ignore

@c There used to be a section "Terminology" here, which defined
@c "contents", "byte", "word", and "long".  Defining "word" to any
@c particular size is confusing when the .word directive may generate 16
@c bits on one machine and 32 bits on another; in general, for the user
@c version of this manual, none of these terms seem essential to define.
@c They were used very little even in the former draft of the manual;
@c this draft makes an effort to avoid them (except in names of
@c directives).

@node LLVM Assembler
@section The LLVM Integrated Assembler

@c man begin DESCRIPTION

The LLVM integrated assembler is really a family of assemblers.
If you use (or have used) the LLVM integrated assembler on one architecture, you
should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another
architecture.  Each version has much in common with the others,
including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called
@dfn{pseudo-ops}) and assembler syntax.@refill

@cindex purpose of the LLVM integrated assembler
The LLVM integrated assembler is primarily intended to assemble the output of
the LLVM compiler for use by the linker.  Nevertheless, we've tried to make the
LLVM integrated assembler handle correctly everything that other assemblers for
the same machine would assemble.

This doesn't mean the assembler always uses the same syntax as another
assembler for the same architecture.  Unlike the @sc{gnu} assembler the LLVM
integrated assembler usually assembles directly from the internal LLVM
Intermediate Represenation (IR) for the machine instructions, rather than from
a separate textual file (although it can also do the latter).

@c man end

Unlike older assemblers, the LLVM integrated is designed to assemble a source
program in one pass of the source file.  This has a subtle impact on the
@kbd{.org} directive (@pxref{Org,,@code{.org}}).

@node Object Formats
@section Object File Formats

@cindex object file format
The LLVM integrated assembler can only produce the ELF object file format with
DWARF debug information.  Unlike the @sc{gnu} assembler, directives for
debugging symbols are only available for the DWARF format.  @xref{Symbol
Attributes,,Symbol Attributes}.

@node Command Line
@section Command Line

@cindex command line conventions

There is no separate command for running the LLVM integrated assembler.  The
assembler is invoked through the Clang front end to LLVM, by giving it
assembler source code.  Since the @command{clang} command supports all LLVM
target architectures, the desired architecture must be specified
@example
clang -march=@var{arch} ...
@end example
It is common practice to provide a symbolic link from clang to architecture
specific command name, which then implies use of that architecture.
@example
@var{arch}-cc ...
@end example

After the program name @command{clang} or @command{@var{arc}-cc}, the command
line may contain options and file names.  Options may appear in any order, and
may be before, after, or between file names.  The order of file names is
significant.

@cindex standard input, as input file
@kindex --
@file{--} (two hyphens) by itself names the standard input file explicitly, as
one of the files to be assembled.

@cindex options, command line
Except for @samp{--} any command line argument that begins with a hyphen
(@samp{-}) is an option.  Each option changes the behavior of the assembler.
No option changes the way another option works.  An option is a @samp{-}
followed by one or more letters; the case of the letter is important.  All
options are optional.

Some options expect exactly one file name to follow them.  The file
name may either immediately follow the option's letter (compatible
with older assemblers) or it may be the next command argument (@sc{gnu}
standard).  These two command lines are equivalent:

@example
@var{arch}-cc -o my-object-file.o mumble.s
@var{arch}-cc -omy-object-file.o mumble.s
@end example

There can sometimes be ambiguity between options for the C/C++ compiler and for
the assembler.  In this case, the option should be preceded by @samp{-Wa,} to
indicate it is intended for the assembler.

@node Input Files
@section Input Files

@cindex input
@cindex source program
@cindex files, input
We use the phrase @dfn{source program}, abbreviated @dfn{source}, to describe
the program input to one run of the LLVM integrated assembler.  The program may
be in one or more files; how the source is partitioned into files doesn't
change the meaning of the source.

@c man begin DESCRIPTION
Unlike the @sc{gnu} assembler, the LLVM integrated assembler will by default
generate a fully linked executable, created by assembling each source file in
turn and then linking them.  Supplying the @samp{-c} option will cause just the
assembly to happen, with one object file produced for each source file.  There
is no concept of concatenating the source files for a single file assembly.

You give a command line that has one or more input file names.  Any with the
suffix @samp{.s} or @samp{.S} will be assembled.  The difference between the
suffixes is that files ending in @samp{.S} will first be passed through the C
pre-processor.  For example
@example
@var{arch}-cc -c hello.s
@end example

The suffix can be overridden using Clang's @samp{-x} option to specify the
language of succeeding files on the commmand line.  For the integrated
assembler, the two useful arguments to the @samp{-x} option are
@samp{assembler} and @samp{assembler-with-cpp}.  So for example, the following
would ensure @file{hello.s} is passed through the C pre-processor before
assembling:
@example
@var{arch}-cc -c -x assembler-with-cpp hello.s
@end example

It is possible to invoke just the assembler by passing the argument
@samp{-cc1as} to Clang.  The assembler does not deduce the architecture from
the command name, and it needs to be told what type of output to produce.  So
for example
@example
@var{arch}-cc -cc1as -triple @var{arch} -filetype obj -o hello.o hello.s
@end example

When used this way, the integrated assembler must be given at most one argument
to assemble.  It can also be used as a pipe:
@example
@var{arch}-cc -cc1as -triple @var{arch} -filetype obj < hello.s > hello.o
@end example

@c man end

@subheading Filenames and Line-numbers

@cindex input file linenumbers
@cindex line numbers, in input files
There are two ways of locating a line in the input file (or files) and
either may be used in reporting error messages.  One way refers to a line
number in a physical file; the other refers to a line number in a
``logical'' file.  @xref{Errors, ,Error and Warning Messages}.

@dfn{Physical files} are those files named in the command line given
to the LLVM integrated assembler.

@dfn{Logical files} are simply names declared explicitly by assembler
directives; they bear no relation to physical files.  Logical file names help
error messages reflect the original source file, when assembler source is
itself synthesized from other files.  The LLVM integrated assembler understands
the @samp{#} directives emitted by the LLVM C preprocessor.  See also
@ref{File,,@code{.file}}.

@node Object
@section Output (Object) File

@cindex object file
@cindex output file
@kindex a.out
@kindex .o
Every time you run the LLVM integrated assembler it produces an output file,
which is your assembly language program translated into numbers.  This file is
the object file.  Its default name is @code{a.out}.  You can give it another
name by using the @option{-o} option.  Conventionally, object file names end
with @file{.o}.  The default name is used for historical reasons: older
assemblers were capable of assembling self-contained programs directly into a
runnable program.  (For some formats, this isn't currently possible, but it can
be done for the @code{a.out} format.)

@cindex linker
@kindex ld
@kindex gold
@kindex mclinker
@kindex lld
The object file is meant for input to the linker.  Clang/LLVM tool chains have
considerable choice of linker to use: GNU @command{ld}, GNU @command{gold}, the
LLVM @command{mc-linker} and the LLVM linker, @command{lld}.  The object file
contains assembled program code, information to help the linker integrate the
assembled program into a runnable file, and (optionally) symbolic information
for the debugger.

@c link above to some info file(s) like the description of a.out.
@c don't forget to describe @sc{gnu} info as well as Unix lossage.

@node Errors
@section Error and Warning Messages

@c man begin DESCRIPTION

@cindex error messages
@cindex warning messages
@cindex messages from assembler
The LLVM integrated assembler may write warnings and error messages to the
standard error file (usually your terminal).  This should not happen when the
Clang/LLVM compiler runs the integrated assembler automatically on assembler
generated from C and C++ programs.  Warnings report an assumption made so that
the assembler could keep assembling a flawed program; errors report a grave
problem that stops the assembly.

@c man end

@cindex format of warning messages
Warning messages have the format

@example
file_name:@b{NNN}:Warning Message Text
@end example

@noindent
@cindex line numbers, in warnings/errors
(where @b{NNN} is a line number).  If a logical file name has been given
(@pxref{File,,@code{.file}}) it is used for the filename, otherwise the name of
the current input file is used.  If a logical line number was given
(@pxref{Line,,@code{.line}})
then it is used to calculate the number printed,
otherwise the actual line in the current source file is printed.  The
message text is intended to be self explanatory (in the grand Unix
tradition).

@cindex format of error messages
Error messages have the format
@example
file_name:@b{NNN}:FATAL:Error Message Text
@end example
The file name and line number are derived as for warning
messages.  The actual message text may be rather less explanatory
because many of them aren't supposed to happen.

@node Invoking
@chapter Command-Line Options

@cindex options, all versions of assembler
This chapter describes command-line options available in @emph{all}
versions of the @sc{gnu} assembler; see @ref{Machine Dependencies},
for options specific
to particular machine architectures.

@c man begin DESCRIPTION

If you are invoking the integrated assembler via the Clang/LLVM C/C++ compiler,
you can use the @samp{-Wa} option to pass arguments through to the assembler.
The assembler arguments must be separated from each other (and the @samp{-Wa})
by commas.  For example:

@example
@var{arch}-cc -c -g -O -Wa,-I.,-compress-debug-sections file.c
@end example

@noindent
This passes two options to the assembler: @samp{-I.} (search for include files
in the current directory) and @samp{-compress-debug-sections} (compress DWARF
debug sections using zlib).

Usually you do not need to use this @samp{-Wa} mechanism, since many options
are automatically passed to the assembler by the compiler.  (You can call the
@sc{gnu} compiler driver with the @samp{-v} option to see precisely what
options it passes to each compilation pass, including the assembler.)

You never need to use @samp{-Wa} if you are invoking the assembler directly
using @samp{-cc1as}.  Any options are assumed to be assembler options.

@section Enable Listings: @option{-a[cdghlns]}

@kindex -a
@kindex -ac
@kindex -ad
@kindex -ag
@kindex -ah
@kindex -al
@kindex -an
@kindex -as
@cindex listings, enabling
@cindex assembly listings, enabling

These options enable listing output from the assembler.  By itself,
@samp{-a} requests high-level, assembly, and symbols listing.
You can use other letters to select specific options for the list:
@samp{-ah} requests a high-level language listing,
@samp{-al} requests an output-program assembly listing, and
@samp{-as} requests a symbol table listing.
High-level listings require that a compiler debugging option like
@samp{-g} be used, and that assembly listings (@samp{-al}) be requested
also.

Use the @samp{-ag} option to print a first section with general assembly
information, like @value{AS} version, switches passed, or time stamp.

Use the @samp{-ac} option to omit false conditionals from a listing.  Any lines
which are not assembled because of a false @code{.if} (or @code{.ifdef}, or any
other conditional), or a true @code{.if} followed by an @code{.else}, will be
omitted from the listing.

Use the @samp{-ad} option to omit debugging directives from the
listing.

Once you have specified one of these options, you can further control
listing output and its appearance using the directives @code{.list},
@code{.nolist}, @code{.psize}, @code{.eject}, @code{.title}, and
@code{.sbttl}.
The @samp{-an} option turns off all forms processing.
If you do not request listing output with one of the @samp{-a} options, the
listing-control directives have no effect.

The letters after @samp{-a} may be combined into one option,
@emph{e.g.}, @samp{-aln}.

Note if the assembler source is coming from the standard input (e.g.,
because it
is being created by @code{@value{GCC}} and the @samp{-pipe} command line switch
is being used) then the listing will not contain any comments or preprocessor
directives.  This is because the listing code buffers input source lines from
stdin only after they have been preprocessed by the assembler.  This reduces
memory usage and makes the code more efficient.

@node alternate
@section @option{--alternate}

@kindex --alternate
Begin in alternate macro mode, see @ref{Altmacro,,@code{.altmacro}}.

@node D
@section @option{-D}

@kindex -D
This option has no effect whatsoever, but it is accepted to make it more
likely that scripts written for other assemblers also work with
@command{@value{AS}}.

@node f
@section Work Faster: @option{-f}

@kindex -f
@cindex trusted compiler
@cindex faster processing (@option{-f})
@samp{-f} should only be used when assembling programs written by a
(trusted) compiler.  @samp{-f} stops the assembler from doing whitespace
and comment preprocessing on
the input file(s) before assembling them.  @xref{Preprocessing,
,Preprocessing}.

@quotation
@emph{Warning:} if you use @samp{-f} when the files actually need to be
preprocessed (if they contain comments, for example), @command{@value{AS}} does
not work correctly.
@end quotation

@node I
@section @code{.include} Search Path: @option{-I} @var{path}

@kindex -I @var{path}
@cindex paths for @code{.include}
@cindex search path for @code{.include}
@cindex @code{include} directive search path
Use this option to add a @var{path} to the list of directories
@command{@value{AS}} searches for files specified in @code{.include}
directives (@pxref{Include,,@code{.include}}).  You may use @option{-I} as
many times as necessary to include a variety of paths.  The current
working directory is always searched first; after that, @command{@value{AS}}
searches any @samp{-I} directories in the same order as they were
specified (left to right) on the command line.

@node K
@section Difference Tables: @option{-K}

@kindex -K
@cindex difference tables, warning
@cindex warning for altered difference tables
@command{@value{AS}} sometimes alters the code emitted for directives of the
form @samp{.word @var{sym1}-@var{sym2}}.  @xref{Word,,@code{.word}}.
You can use the @samp{-K} option if you want a warning issued when this
is done.

@node L
@section Include Local Symbols: @option{-L}

@kindex -L
@cindex local symbols, retaining in output
Symbols beginning with system-specific local label prefixes, typically
@samp{.L} for ELF systems or @samp{L} for traditional a.out systems, are
called @dfn{local symbols}.  @xref{Symbol Names}.  Normally you do not see
such symbols when debugging, because they are intended for the use of
programs (like compilers) that compose assembler programs, not for your
notice.  Normally both @command{@value{AS}} and @code{@value{LD}} discard
such symbols, so you do not normally debug with them.

This option tells @command{@value{AS}} to retain those local symbols
in the object file.  Usually if you do this you also tell the linker
@code{@value{LD}} to preserve those symbols.

@node listing
@section Configuring listing output: @option{--listing}

The listing feature of the assembler can be enabled via the command line switch
@samp{-a} (@pxref{a}).  This feature combines the input source file(s) with a
hex dump of the corresponding locations in the output object file, and displays
them as a listing file.  The format of this listing can be controlled by
directives inside the assembler source (i.e., @code{.list} (@pxref{List}),
@code{.title} (@pxref{Title}), @code{.sbttl} (@pxref{Sbttl}),
@code{.psize} (@pxref{Psize}), and
@code{.eject} (@pxref{Eject}) and also by the following switches:

@table @code
@item --listing-lhs-width=@samp{number}
@kindex --listing-lhs-width
@cindex Width of first line disassembly output
Sets the maximum width, in words, of the first line of the hex byte dump.  This

@section Assemble in MRI Compatibility Mode: @option{-M}

@kindex -M
@cindex MRI compatibility mode
The @option{-M} or @option{--mri} option selects MRI compatibility mode.  This
changes the syntax and pseudo-op handling of @command{@value{AS}} to make it
compatible with the @code{ASM68K} or the @code{ASM960} (depending upon the
configured target) assembler from Microtec Research.  The exact nature of the
MRI syntax will not be documented here; see the MRI manuals for more
information.  Note in particular that the handling of macros and macro
arguments is somewhat different.  The purpose of this option is to permit
assembling existing MRI assembler code using @command{@value{AS}}.

The MRI compatibility is not complete.  Certain operations of the MRI assembler
depend upon its object file format, and can not be supported using other object
file formats.  Supporting these would require enhancing each object file format
individually.  These are:

@itemize @bullet
@item global symbols in common section

The m68k MRI assembler supports common sections which are merged by the linker.
Other object file formats do not support this.  @command{@value{AS}} handles
common sections by treating them as a single common symbol.  It permits local
symbols to be defined within a common section, but it can not support global
symbols, since it has no way to describe them.

@item complex relocations

The MRI assemblers support relocations against a negated section address, and
relocations which combine the start addresses of two or more sections.  These
are not support by other object file formats.

@item @code{END} pseudo-op specifying start address

The MRI @code{END} pseudo-op permits the specification of a start address.
This is not supported by other object file formats.  The start address may
instead be specified using the @option{-e} option to the linker, or in a linker
script.

@item @code{IDNT}, @code{.ident} and @code{NAME} pseudo-ops

The MRI @code{IDNT}, @code{.ident} and @code{NAME} pseudo-ops assign a module
name to the output file.  This is not supported by other object file formats.

@item @code{ORG} pseudo-op

The m68k MRI @code{ORG} pseudo-op begins an absolute section at a given
address.  This differs from the usual @command{@value{AS}} @code{.org} pseudo-op,
which changes the location within the current section.  Absolute sections are
not supported by other object file formats.  The address of a section may be
assigned within a linker script.
@end itemize

There are some other features of the MRI assembler which are not supported by
@command{@value{AS}}, typically either because they are difficult or because they
seem of little consequence.  Some of these may be supported in future releases.

@itemize @bullet

@item EBCDIC strings

EBCDIC strings are not supported.

@item packed binary coded decimal

Packed binary coded decimal is not supported.  This means that the @code{DC.P}
and @code{DCB.P} pseudo-ops are not supported.

@item @code{FEQU} pseudo-op

The m68k @code{FEQU} pseudo-op is not supported.

@item @code{NOOBJ} pseudo-op

The m68k @code{NOOBJ} pseudo-op is not supported.

@item @code{OPT} branch control options

The m68k @code{OPT} branch control options---@code{B}, @code{BRS}, @code{BRB},
@code{BRL}, and @code{BRW}---are ignored.  @command{@value{AS}} automatically
relaxes all branches, whether forward or backward, to an appropriate size, so
these options serve no purpose.

@item @code{OPT} list control options

The following m68k @code{OPT} list control options are ignored: @code{C},
@code{CEX}, @code{CL}, @code{CRE}, @code{E}, @code{G}, @code{I}, @code{M},
@code{MEX}, @code{MC}, @code{MD}, @code{X}.

@item other @code{OPT} options

The following m68k @code{OPT} options are ignored: @code{NEST}, @code{O},
@code{OLD}, @code{OP}, @code{P}, @code{PCO}, @code{PCR}, @code{PCS}, @code{R}.

@item @code{OPT} @code{D} option is default

The m68k @code{OPT} @code{D} option is the default, unlike the MRI assembler.
@code{OPT NOD} may be used to turn it off.

@item @code{XREF} pseudo-op.

The m68k @code{XREF} pseudo-op is ignored.

@item @code{.debug} pseudo-op

The i960 @code{.debug} pseudo-op is not supported.

@item @code{.extended} pseudo-op

The i960 @code{.extended} pseudo-op is not supported.

@item @code{.list} pseudo-op.

The various options of the i960 @code{.list} pseudo-op are not supported.

@item @code{.optimize} pseudo-op

The i960 @code{.optimize} pseudo-op is not supported.

@item @code{.output} pseudo-op

The i960 @code{.output} pseudo-op is not supported.

@item @code{.setreal} pseudo-op

The i960 @code{.setreal} pseudo-op is not supported.

@node MD
@section Dependency Tracking: @option{--MD}

@kindex --MD
@cindex dependency tracking
@cindex make rules

@command{@value{AS}} can generate a dependency file for the file it creates.  This
file consists of a single rule suitable for @code{make} describing the
dependencies of the main source file.

The rule is written to the file named in its argument.

This feature is used in the automatic updating of makefiles.

@node o
@section Name the Object File: @option{-o}

@kindex -o
@cindex naming object file
@cindex object file name
There is always one object file output when you run @command{@value{AS}}.  By
default it has the name
@ifset I960
@file{a.out} (or @file{b.out}, for Intel 960 targets only).
@end ifset
@ifclear I960
@file{a.out}.
@end ifclear
You use this option (which takes exactly one filename) to give the
object file a different name.

Whatever the object file is called, @command{@value{AS}} overwrites any
existing file of the same name.

@node R
@section Join Data and Text Sections: @option{-R}

@kindex -R
@cindex data and text sections, joining
@cindex text and data sections, joining
@cindex joining text and data sections
@cindex merging text and data sections
@option{-R} tells @command{@value{AS}} to write the object file as if all
data-section data lives in the text section.  This is only done at
the very last moment:  your binary data are the same, but data
section parts are relocated differently.  The data section part of
your object file is zero bytes long because all its bytes are
appended to the text section.  (@xref{Sections,,Sections and Relocation}.)

When you specify @option{-R} it would be possible to generate shorter
address displacements (because we do not have to cross between text and
data section).  We refrain from doing this simply for compatibility with
older versions of @command{@value{AS}}.  In future, @option{-R} may work this way.

When @command{@value{AS}} is configured for COFF or ELF output,
this option is only useful if you use sections named @samp{.text} and
@samp{.data}.

@ifset HPPA
@option{-R} is not supported for any of the HPPA targets.  Using
@option{-R} generates a warning from @command{@value{AS}}.
@end ifset

@node statistics
@section Display Assembly Statistics: @option{--statistics}

@kindex --statistics
@cindex statistics, about assembly
@cindex time, total for assembly
@cindex space used, maximum for assembly
Use @samp{--statistics} to display two statistics about the resources used by
@command{@value{AS}}: the maximum amount of space allocated during the assembly
(in bytes), and the total execution time taken for the assembly (in @sc{cpu}
seconds).

@node traditional-format
@section Compatible Output: @option{--traditional-format}

@kindex --traditional-format
For some targets, the output of @command{@value{AS}} is different in some ways
from the output of some existing assembler.  This switch requests
@command{@value{AS}} to use the traditional format instead.

For example, it disables the exception frame optimizations which
@command{@value{AS}} normally does by default on @code{@value{GCC}} output.

@node v
@section Announce Version: @option{-v}

@kindex -v
@kindex -version
@cindex assembler version
@cindex version of assembler
You can find out what version of as is running by including the
option @samp{-v} (which you can also spell as @samp{-version}) on the
command line.

@node W
@section Control Warnings: @option{-W}, @option{--warn}, @option{--no-warn}, @option{--fatal-warnings}

@command{@value{AS}} should never give a warning or error message when
assembling compiler output.  But programs written by people often
cause @command{@value{AS}} to give a warning that a particular assumption was
made.  All such warnings are directed to the standard error file.

@kindex -W
@kindex --no-warn
@cindex suppressing warnings
@cindex warnings, suppressing
If you use the @option{-W} and @option{--no-warn} options, no warnings are issued.
This only affects the warning messages: it does not change any particular of
how @command{@value{AS}} assembles your file.  Errors, which stop the assembly,
are still reported.

@kindex --fatal-warnings
@cindex errors, caused by warnings
@cindex warnings, causing error
If you use the @option{--fatal-warnings} option, @command{@value{AS}} considers
files that generate warnings to be in error.

@kindex --warn
@cindex warnings, switching on
You can switch these options off again by specifying @option{--warn}, which
causes warnings to be output as usual.

@node Z
@section Generate Object File in Spite of Errors: @option{-Z}
@cindex object file, after errors
@cindex errors, continuing after
After an error message, @command{@value{AS}} normally produces no output.  If for
some reason you are interested in object file output even after
@command{@value{AS}} gives an error message on your program, use the @samp{-Z}
option.  If there are any errors, @command{@value{AS}} continues anyways, and
writes an object file after a final warning message of the form @samp{@var{n}
errors, @var{m} warnings, generating bad object file.}

@node Syntax
@chapter Syntax

@cindex machine-independent syntax
@cindex syntax, machine-independent
This chapter describes the machine-independent syntax allowed in a

@node Preprocessing
@section Preprocessing

@cindex preprocessing
The @command{@value{AS}} internal preprocessor:
@itemize @bullet
@cindex whitespace, removed by preprocessor
@item
adjusts and removes extra whitespace.  It leaves one space or tab before
the keywords on a line, and turns any other whitespace on the line into
a single space.

@cindex comments, removed by preprocessor
@item
removes all comments, replacing them with a single space, or an
appropriate number of newlines.

@cindex constants, converted by preprocessor
@item
converts character constants into the appropriate numeric values.
@end itemize

It does not do macro processing, include file handling, or
anything else you may get from your C compiler's preprocessor.  You can
do include file processing with the @code{.include} directive
(@pxref{Include,,@code{.include}}).  You can use the @sc{gnu} C compiler driver
to get other ``CPP'' style preprocessing by giving the input file a
@samp{.S} suffix.  @xref{Overall Options, ,Options Controlling the Kind of
Output, gcc.info, Using GNU CC}.

Excess whitespace, comments, and character constants
cannot be used in the portions of the input text that are not
preprocessed.

@kindex #NO_APP
@kindex #APP
If the first line of an input file is @code{#NO_APP} or if you use the
@samp{-f} option, whitespace and comments are not removed from the input file.
Within an input file, you can ask for whitespace and comment removal in
specific portions of the by putting a line that says @code{#APP} before the
text that may contain whitespace or comments, and putting a line that says
@code{#NO_APP} after this text.  This feature is mainly intend to support
@code{asm} statements in compilers whose output is otherwise free of comments
and whitespace.

@node Whitespace
@section Whitespace

@cindex whitespace
@dfn{Whitespace} is one or more blanks or tabs, in any order.
Whitespace is used to separate symbols, and to make programs neater for
people to read.  Unless within character constants
(@pxref{Characters,,Character Constants}), any whitespace means the same
as exactly one space.

@node Comments
@section Comments

@cindex comments
There are two ways of rendering comments to @command{@value{AS}}.  In both
cases the comment is equivalent to one space.

Anything from @samp{/*} through the next @samp{*/} is a comment.
This means you may not nest these comments.

@example
/*
  The only way to include a newline ('\n') in a comment
  is to use this sort of comment.
*/

/* This sort of comment does not nest. */
@end example

@cindex line comment character
Anything from a @dfn{line comment} character up to the next newline is
considered a comment and is ignored.  The line comment character is target
specific, and some targets multiple comment characters.  Some targets also have
line comment characters that only work if they are the first character on a
line.  Some targets use a sequence of two characters to introduce a line
comment.  Some targets can also change their line comment characters depending
upon command line options that have been used.  For more details see the
@emph{Syntax} section in the documentation for individual targets.

If the line comment character is the hash sign (@samp{#}) then it still has the
special ability to enable and disable preprocessing (@pxref{Preprocessing}) and
to specify logical line numbers:

@kindex #
@cindex lines starting with @code{#}
@cindex logical line numbers
To be compatible with past assemblers, lines that begin with @samp{#} have a
special interpretation.  Following the @samp{#} should be an absolute
expression (@pxref{Expressions}): the logical line number of the @emph{next}
line.  Then a string (@pxref{Strings, ,Strings}) is allowed: if present it is a
new logical file name.  The rest of the line, if any, should be whitespace.

If the first non-whitespace characters on the line are not numeric,
the line is ignored.  (Just like a comment.)

@example
                          # This is an ordinary comment.
# 42-6 "new_file_name"    # New logical file name
                          # This is logical line # 36.
@end example
This feature is deprecated, and may disappear from future versions
of @command{@value{AS}}.

@node Symbol Intro
@section Symbols

@cindex characters used in symbols
@ifclear SPECIAL-SYMS
A @dfn{symbol} is one or more characters chosen from the set of all
letters (both upper and lower case), digits and the three characters
@samp{_.$}.
@end ifclear
On most machines, you can also use @code{$} in symbol names; exceptions
are noted in @ref{Machine Dependencies}.
No symbol may begin with a digit.  Case is significant.
There is no length limit: all characters are significant.  Multibyte characters
are supported.  Symbols are delimited by characters not in that set, or by the
beginning of a file (since the source program must end with a newline, the end
of a file is not a possible symbol delimiter).  @xref{Symbols}.

@node Statements
@section Statements

@cindex statements, structure of
@cindex line separator character
@cindex statement separator character

A @dfn{statement} ends at a newline character (@samp{\n}) or a
@dfn{line separator character}.  The line separator character is target
specific and described in the @emph{Syntax} section of each
target's documentation.  Not all targets support a line separator character.
The newline or line separator character is considered to be part of the
preceding statement.  Newlines and separators within character constants are an
exception: they do not end statements.

@cindex newline, required at file end
@cindex EOF, newline must precede
It is an error to end any statement with end-of-file:  the last
character of any input file should be a newline.@refill

An empty statement is allowed, and may include whitespace.  It is ignored.

@cindex instructions and directives
@cindex directives and instructions
@c "key symbol" is not used elsewhere in the document; seems pedantic to
@c @defn{} it in that case, as was done previously...  doc@cygnus.com,
@c 13feb91.
A statement begins with zero or more labels, optionally followed by a
key symbol which determines what kind of statement it is.  The key
symbol determines the syntax of the rest of the statement.  If the
symbol begins with a dot @samp{.} then the statement is an assembler
directive: typically valid for any computer.  If the symbol begins with
a letter the statement is an assembly language @dfn{instruction}: it
assembles into a machine language instruction.
Different versions of @command{@value{AS}} for different computers
recognize different instructions.  In fact, the same symbol may
represent a different instruction in a different computer's assembly
language.@refill

@cindex @code{:} (label)
@cindex label (@code{:})
A label is a symbol immediately followed by a colon (@code{:}).
Whitespace before a label or after a colon is permitted, but you may not
have whitespace between a label's symbol and its colon. @xref{Labels}.

@ifset HPPA
For HPPA targets, labels need not be immediately followed by a colon, but
the definition of a label must begin in column zero.  This also implies that
only one label may be defined on each line.
@end ifset

@example

A constant is a number, written so that its value is known by

There are two kinds of character constants.  A @dfn{character} stands

@subsubsection Strings

@cindex string constants
@cindex constants, string
A @dfn{string} is written between double-quotes.  It may contain
double-quotes or null characters.  The way to get special characters
into a string is to @dfn{escape} these characters: precede them with
a backslash @samp{\} character.  For example @samp{\\} represents
one backslash:  the first @code{\} is an escape which tells
@command{@value{AS}} to interpret the second character literally as a backslash
(which prevents @command{@value{AS}} from recognizing the second @code{\} as an
escape character).  The complete list of escapes follows.

@cindex octal character code (@code{\@var{ddd}})
@item \ @var{digit} @var{digit} @var{digit}
An octal character code.  The numeric code is 3 octal digits.
For compatibility with other Unix systems, 8 and 9 are accepted as digits:
for example, @code{\008} has the value 010, and @code{\009} the value 011.

@cindex @code{\@var{xd...}} (hex character code)
@cindex hex character code (@code{\@var{xd...}})
@item \@code{x} @var{hex-digits...}
A hex character code.  All trailing hex digits are combined.  Either upper or
lower case @code{x} works.

@cindex @code{\\} (@samp{\} character)
@cindex backslash (@code{\\})
@item \\
Represents one @samp{\} character.

@c      @item \'
@c      Represents one @samp{'} (accent acute) character.
@c      This is needed in single character literals
@c      (@xref{Characters,,Character Constants}.) to represent
@c      a @samp{'}.
@c
@cindex @code{\"} (doublequote character)
@cindex doublequote (@code{\"})
@item \"
Represents one @samp{"} character.  Needed in strings to represent
this character, because an unescaped @samp{"} would end the string.

@item \ @var{anything-else}
Any other character when escaped by @kbd{\} gives a warning, but
assembles as if the @samp{\} was not present.  The idea is that if
you used an escape sequence you clearly didn't want the literal
interpretation of the following character.  However @command{@value{AS}} has no
other interpretation, so @command{@value{AS}} knows it is giving you the wrong
code and warns you of the fact.
@end table

Which characters are escapable, and what those escapes represent,
varies widely among assemblers.  The current set is what we think
the BSD 4.2 assembler recognizes, and is a subset of what most C
compilers recognize.  If you are in doubt, do not use an escape
sequence.

@node Chars
@subsubsection Characters

@cindex single character constant
@cindex character, single
@cindex constant, single character
A single character may be written as a single quote immediately
followed by that character.  The same escapes apply to characters as
to strings.  So if you want to write the character backslash, you
must write @kbd{'\\} where the first @code{\} escapes the second
@code{\}.  As you can see, the quote is an acute accent, not a
grave accent.  A newline
immediately following an acute accent is taken as a literal character
and does not count as the end of a statement.  The value of a character
constant in a numeric expression is the machine's byte-wide code for
that character.  @command{@value{AS}} assumes your character code is ASCII:
@kbd{'A} means 65, @kbd{'B} means 66, and so on. @refill

@cindex constants, bignum
A @dfn{bignum} has the same syntax and semantics as an integer

@command{@value{AS}} to a generic binary floating point number of more than
sufficient precision.  This generic floating point number is converted
to a particular computer's floating point format (or formats) by a
portion of @command{@value{AS}} specialized to that computer.

A flonum is written by writing (in order)
@itemize @bullet
@item
The digit @samp{0}.
@ifset HPPA
(@samp{0} is optional on the HPPA.)
@end ifset

@item
A letter, to tell @command{@value{AS}} the rest of the number is a flonum.
@kbd{e} is recommended.  Case is not important.
@ignore
@c FIXME: verify if flonum syntax really this vague for most cases
(Any otherwise illegal letter works here, but that might be changed.  Vax BSD
4.2 assembler seems to allow any of @samp{defghDEFGH}.)
@end ignore

On the H8/300, Renesas / SuperH SH,
and AMD 29K architectures, the letter must be
one of the letters @samp{DFPRSX} (in upper or lower case).

On the ARC, the letter must be one of the letters @samp{DFRS}
(in upper or lower case).

On the Intel 960 architecture, the letter must be
one of the letters @samp{DFT} (in upper or lower case).

On the HPPA architecture, the letter must be @samp{E} (upper case only).

@item
An optional sign: either @samp{+} or @samp{-}.

@item
An optional @dfn{integer part}: zero or more decimal digits.

@item
An optional @dfn{fractional part}: @samp{.} followed by zero
or more decimal digits.

@item
An optional exponent, consisting of:

@itemize @bullet
@item
An @samp{E} or @samp{e}.
@c I can't find a config where "EXP_CHARS" is other than 'eE', but in
@c principle this can perfectly well be different on different targets.
@item
Optional sign: either @samp{+} or @samp{-}.
@item
One or more decimal digits.
@end itemize

@end itemize

At least one of the integer part or the fractional part must be
present.  The floating point number has the usual base-10 value.

@command{@value{AS}} does all processing using integers.  Flonums are computed
independently of any floating point hardware in the computer running
@command{@value{AS}}.

@node Secs Background
@section Background

Roughly, a section is a range of addresses, with no gaps; all data
``in'' those addresses is treated the same for some particular purpose.
For example there may be a ``read only'' section.

@cindex linker, and assembler
@cindex assembler, and linker
The linker @code{@value{LD}} reads many object files (partial programs) and
combines their contents to form a runnable program.  When @command{@value{AS}}
emits an object file, the partial program is assumed to start at address 0.
@code{@value{LD}} assigns the final addresses for the partial program, so that
different partial programs do not overlap.  This is actually an
oversimplification, but it suffices to explain how @command{@value{AS}} uses
sections.

@code{@value{LD}} moves blocks of bytes of your program to their run-time
addresses.  These blocks slide to their run-time addresses as rigid
units; their length does not change and neither does the order of bytes
within them.  Such a rigid unit is called a @emph{section}.  Assigning
run-time addresses to sections is called @dfn{relocation}.  It includes
the task of adjusting mentions of object-file addresses so they refer to
the proper run-time addresses.
@ifset H8
For the H8/300, and for the Renesas / SuperH SH,
@command{@value{AS}} pads sections if needed to
ensure they end on a word (sixteen bit) boundary.
@end ifset

@cindex standard assembler sections
An object file written by @command{@value{AS}} has at least three sections, any
of which may be empty.  These are named @dfn{text}, @dfn{data} and
@dfn{bss} sections.

When it generates COFF or ELF output,
@command{@value{AS}} can also generate whatever other named sections you specify
using the @samp{.section} directive (@pxref{Section,,@code{.section}}).
If you do not use any directives that place output in the @samp{.text}
or @samp{.data} sections, these sections still exist, but are empty.

@ifset HPPA
When @command{@value{AS}} generates SOM or ELF output for the HPPA,
@command{@value{AS}} can also generate whatever other named sections you
specify using the @samp{.space} and @samp{.subspace} directives.  See
@cite{HP9000 Series 800 Assembly Language Reference Manual}
(HP 92432-90001) for details on the @samp{.space} and @samp{.subspace}
assembler directives.

@ifset SOM
Additionally, @command{@value{AS}} uses different names for the standard
text, data, and bss sections when generating SOM output.  Program text
is placed into the @samp{$CODE$} section, data into @samp{$DATA$}, and
BSS into @samp{$BSS$}.
@end ifset
@end ifset

Within the object file, the text section starts at address @code{0}, the
data section follows, and the bss section follows the data section.

@ifset HPPA
When generating either SOM or ELF output files on the HPPA, the text
section starts at address @code{0}, the data section at address
@code{0x4000000}, and the bss section follows the data section.
@end ifset

To let @code{@value{LD}} know which data changes when the sections are
relocated, and how to change that data, @command{@value{AS}} also writes to the
object file details of the relocation needed.  To perform relocation
@code{@value{LD}} must know, each time an address in the object
file is mentioned:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Where in the object file is the beginning of this reference to
an address?
@item
How long (in bytes) is this reference?
@item
Which section does the address refer to?  What is the numeric value of
@display
(@var{address}) @minus{} (@var{start-address of section})?
@end display
@item
Is the reference to an address ``Program-Counter relative''?
@end itemize

@cindex addresses, format of
@cindex section-relative addressing
In fact, every address @command{@value{AS}} ever uses is expressed as
@display
(@var{section}) + (@var{offset into section})
@end display
@noindent
Further, most expressions @command{@value{AS}} computes have this section-relative
nature.
@ifset SOM
(For some object formats, such as SOM for the HPPA, some expressions are
symbol-relative instead.)
@end ifset

In this manual we use the notation @{@var{secname} @var{N}@} to mean ``offset
@var{N} into section @var{secname}.''

Apart from text, data and bss sections you need to know about the
@dfn{absolute} section.  When @code{@value{LD}} mixes partial programs,
addresses in the absolute section remain unchanged.  For example, address
@code{@{absolute 0@}} is ``relocated'' to run-time address 0 by
@code{@value{LD}}.  Although the linker never arranges two partial programs'
data sections with overlapping addresses after linking, @emph{by definition}
their absolute sections must overlap.  Address @code{@{absolute@ 239@}} in one
part of a program is always the same address when the program is running as
address @code{@{absolute@ 239@}} in any other part of the program.

The idea of sections is extended to the @dfn{undefined} section.  Any
address whose section is unknown at assembly time is by definition
rendered @{undefined @var{U}@}---where @var{U} is filled in later.
Since numbers are always defined, the only way to generate an undefined
address is to mention an undefined symbol.  A reference to a named
common block would be such a symbol: its value is unknown at assembly
time so it has section @emph{undefined}.

By analogy the word @emph{section} is used to describe groups of sections in
the linked program.  @code{@value{LD}} puts all partial programs' text
sections in contiguous addresses in the linked program.  It is
customary to refer to the @emph{text section} of a program, meaning all
the addresses of all partial programs' text sections.  Likewise for
data and bss sections.

Some sections are manipulated by @code{@value{LD}}; others are invented for
use of @command{@value{AS}} and have no meaning except during assembly.

@node Ld Sections
@section Linker Sections
@code{@value{LD}} deals with just four kinds of sections, summarized below.

@table @strong

@cindex named sections
@cindex sections, named
@item named sections
@ifset aout-bout
@cindex text section
@cindex data section
@itemx text section
@itemx data section
@end ifset
These sections hold your program.  @command{@value{AS}} and @code{@value{LD}} treat them as
separate but equal sections.  Anything you can say of one section is
true of another.
@c @ifset aout-bout
When the program is running, however, it is
customary for the text section to be unalterable.  The
text section is often shared among processes: it contains
instructions, constants and the like.  The data section of a running
program is usually alterable: for example, C variables would be stored
in the data section.
@c @end ifset

@cindex bss section
@item bss section
This section contains zeroed bytes when your program begins running.  It
is used to hold uninitialized variables or common storage.  The length of
each partial program's bss section is important, but because it starts
out containing zeroed bytes there is no need to store explicit zero
bytes in the object file.  The bss section was invented to eliminate
those explicit zeros from object files.

@cindex absolute section
@item absolute section
Address 0 of this section is always ``relocated'' to runtime address 0.
This is useful if you want to refer to an address that @code{@value{LD}} must
not change when relocating.  In this sense we speak of absolute
addresses being ``unrelocatable'': they do not change during relocation.

@cindex undefined section
@item undefined section
This ``section'' is a catch-all for address references to objects not in
the preceding sections.
@c FIXME: ref to some other doc on obj-file formats could go here.
@end table

@cindex relocation example
An idealized example of three relocatable sections follows.
The example uses the traditional section names @samp{.text} and @samp{.data}.
Memory addresses are on the horizontal axis.

@node As Sections
@section Assembler Internal Sections

@cindex internal assembler sections
@cindex sections in messages, internal
These sections are meant only for the internal use of @command{@value{AS}}.  They
have no meaning at run-time.  You do not really need to know about these
sections for most purposes; but they can be mentioned in @command{@value{AS}}
warning messages, so it might be helpful to have an idea of their
meanings to @command{@value{AS}}.  These sections are used to permit the
value of every expression in your assembly language program to be a
section-relative address.

@table @b

@end table

@node Sub-Sections
@section Sub-Sections

@cindex numbered subsections
@cindex grouping data
@ifset aout-bout
Assembled bytes
conventionally
fall into two sections: text and data.
@end ifset
You may have separate groups of
data in named sections
that you want to end up near to each other in the object file, even though they
are not contiguous in the assembler source.  @command{@value{AS}} allows you to
use @dfn{subsections} for this purpose.  Within each section, there can be
numbered subsections with values from 0 to 8192.  Objects assembled into the
same subsection go into the object file together with other objects in the same
subsection.  For example, a compiler might want to store constants in the text
section, but might not want to have them interspersed with the program being
assembled.  In this case, the compiler could issue a @samp{.text 0} before each
section of code being output, and a @samp{.text 1} before each group of
constants being output.

Subsections are optional.  If you do not use subsections, everything
goes in subsection number zero.

Each subsection is zero-padded up to a multiple of four bytes.
(Subsections may be padded a different amount on different flavors
of @command{@value{AS}}.)

Subsections appear in your object file in numeric order, lowest numbered
to highest.  (All this to be compatible with other people's assemblers.)
The object file contains no representation of subsections; @code{@value{LD}} and
other programs that manipulate object files see no trace of them.
They just see all your text subsections as a text section, and all your
data subsections as a data section.

To specify which subsection you want subsequent statements assembled
into, use a numeric argument to specify it, in a @samp{.text
@var{expression}} or a @samp{.data @var{expression}} statement.
@ifset COFF
When generating COFF output, you
can also use an extra subsection
argument with arbitrary named sections: @samp{.section @var{name},
@var{expression}}.
@end ifset
@ifset ELF
When generating ELF output, you
can also use the @code{.subsection} directive (@pxref{SubSection})
to specify a subsection: @samp{.subsection @var{expression}}.
@end ifset
@var{Expression} should be an absolute expression
(@pxref{Expressions}).  If you just say @samp{.text} then @samp{.text 0}
is assumed.  Likewise @samp{.data} means @samp{.data 0}.  Assembly
begins in @code{text 0}.  For instance:
@example
.text 0     # The default subsection is text 0 anyway.
.ascii "This lives in the first text subsection. *"
.text 1
.ascii "But this lives in the second text subsection."
.data 0
.ascii "This lives in the data section,"
.ascii "in the first data subsection."
.text 0
.ascii "This lives in the first text section,"
.ascii "immediately following the asterisk (*)."
@end example

Each section has a @dfn{location counter} incremented by one for every byte
assembled into that section.  Because subsections are merely a convenience
restricted to @command{@value{AS}} there is no concept of a subsection location
counter.  There is no way to directly manipulate a location counter---but the
@code{.align} directive changes it, and any label definition captures its
current value.  The location counter of the section where statements are being
assembled is said to be the @dfn{active} location counter.

@node bss
@section bss Section

@cindex bss section
@cindex common variable storage
The bss section is used for local common variable storage.
You may allocate address space in the bss section, but you may
not dictate data to load into it before your program executes.  When
your program starts running, all the contents of the bss
section are zeroed bytes.

The @code{.lcomm} pseudo-op defines a symbol in the bss section; see
@ref{Lcomm,,@code{.lcomm}}.

The @code{.comm} pseudo-op may be used to declare a common symbol, which is
another form of uninitialized symbol; see @ref{Comm,,@code{.comm}}.

When assembling for a target which supports multiple sections, such as ELF or
COFF, you may switch into the @code{.bss} section and define symbols as usual;
see @ref{Section,,@code{.section}}.  You may only assemble zero values into the
section.  Typically the section will only contain symbol definitions and
@code{.skip} directives (@pxref{Skip,,@code{.skip}}).

@node Symbols

@cindex symbols
Symbols are a central concept: the programmer uses symbols to name
things, the linker uses symbols to link, and the debugger uses symbols
to debug.

@node Labels
@section Labels

@cindex labels
A @dfn{label} is written as a symbol immediately followed by a colon
@samp{:}.  The symbol then represents the current value of the
active location counter, and is, for example, a suitable instruction
operand.  You are warned if you use the same symbol to represent two
different locations: the first definition overrides any other
definitions.

@ifset HPPA
On the HPPA, the usual form for a label need not be immediately followed by a
colon, but instead must start in column zero.  Only one label may be defined on
a single line.  To work around this, the HPPA version of @command{@value{AS}} also
provides a special directive @code{.label} for defining labels more flexibly.
@end ifset

@node Setting Symbols
@section Giving Symbols Other Values

@cindex assigning values to symbols
@cindex symbol values, assigning
A symbol can be given an arbitrary value by writing a symbol, followed
by an equals sign @samp{=}, followed by an expression
(@pxref{Expressions}).  This is equivalent to using the @code{.set}
directive.  @xref{Set,,@code{.set}}.  In the same way, using a double
equals sign @samp{=}@samp{=} here represents an equivalent of the
@code{.eqv} directive.  @xref{Eqv,,@code{.eqv}}.

@ifset Blackfin
Blackfin does not support symbol assignment with @samp{=}.
@end ifset

@node Symbol Names
@section Symbol Names

@cindex symbol names
@cindex names, symbol
@ifclear SPECIAL-SYMS
Symbol names begin with a letter or with one of @samp{._}.  On most
machines, you can also use @code{$} in symbol names; exceptions are
noted in @ref{Machine Dependencies}.  That character may be followed by any
string of digits, letters, dollar signs (unless otherwise noted for a
particular target machine), and underscores.
@end ifclear
@ifset SPECIAL-SYMS
@ifset H8
Symbol names begin with a letter or with one of @samp{._}.  On the
Renesas SH you can also use @code{$} in symbol names.  That
character may be followed by any string of digits, letters, dollar signs (save
on the H8/300), and underscores.
@end ifset
@end ifset

Case of letters is significant: @code{foo} is a different symbol name
than @code{Foo}.

Multibyte characters are supported.  To generate a symbol name containing
multibyte characters enclose it within double quotes and use escape codes. cf
@xref{Strings}.  Generating a multibyte symbol name from a label is not
currently supported.

Each symbol has exactly one name.  Each name in an assembly language program
refers to exactly one symbol.  You may use that symbol name any number of times
in a program.

@subheading Local Symbol Names

@cindex local symbol names
@cindex symbol names, local
A local symbol is any symbol beginning with certain local label prefixes.
By default, the local label prefix is @samp{.L} for ELF systems or
@samp{L} for traditional a.out systems, but each target may have its own
set of local label prefixes.
@ifset HPPA
On the HPPA local symbols begin with @samp{L$}.
@end ifset

Local symbols are defined and used within the assembler, but they are
normally not saved in object files.  Thus, they are not visible when debugging.
You may use the @samp{-L} option (@pxref{L, ,Include Local Symbols})
to retain the local symbols in the object files.

@subheading Local Labels

@cindex local labels
@cindex temporary symbol names
@cindex symbol names, temporary
Local labels help compilers and programmers use names temporarily.
They create symbols which are guaranteed to be unique over the entire scope of
the input source code and which can be referred to by a simple notation.
To define a local label, write a label of the form @samp{@b{N}:} (where @b{N}
represents any positive integer).  To refer to the most recent previous
definition of that label write @samp{@b{N}b}, using the same number as when
you defined the label.  To refer to the next definition of a local label, write
@samp{@b{N}f}---the @samp{b} stands for ``backwards'' and the @samp{f} stands
for ``forwards''.

There is no restriction on how you can use these labels, and you can reuse them
too.  So that it is possible to repeatedly define the same local label (using
the same number @samp{@b{N}}), although you can only refer to the most recently
defined local label of that number (for a backwards reference) or the next
definition of a specific local label for a forward reference.  It is also worth
noting that the first 10 local labels (@samp{@b{0:}}@dots{}@samp{@b{9:}}) are
implemented in a slightly more efficient manner than the others.

Here is an example:

@example
1:        branch 1f
2:        branch 1b
1:        branch 2f
2:        branch 1b
@end example

Which is the equivalent of:

@example
label_1:  branch label_3
label_2:  branch label_1
label_3:  branch label_4
label_4:  branch label_3
@end example

Local label names are only a notational device.  They are immediately
transformed into more conventional symbol names before the assembler uses them.
The symbol names are stored in the symbol table, appear in error messages, and
are optionally emitted to the object file.  The names are constructed using
these parts:

@table @code
@item @emph{local label prefix}
All local symbols begin with the system-specific local label prefix.
Normally both @command{@value{AS}} and @code{@value{LD}} forget symbols
that start with the local label prefix.  These labels are
used for symbols you are never intended to see.  If you use the
@samp{-L} option then @command{@value{AS}} retains these symbols in the
object file. If you also instruct @code{@value{LD}} to retain these symbols,
you may use them in debugging.

@item @var{number}
This is the number that was used in the local label definition.  So if the
label is written @samp{55:} then the number is @samp{55}.

@item @kbd{C-B}
This unusual character is included so you do not accidentally invent a symbol
of the same name.  The character has ASCII value of @samp{\002} (control-B).

@item @emph{ordinal number}
This is a serial number to keep the labels distinct.  The first definition of
@samp{0:} gets the number @samp{1}.  The 15th definition of @samp{0:} gets the
number @samp{15}, and so on.  Likewise the first definition of @samp{1:} gets
the number @samp{1} and its 15th definition gets @samp{15} as well.
@end table

So for example, the first @code{1:} may be named @code{.L1@kbd{C-B}1}, and
the 44th @code{3:} may be named @code{.L3@kbd{C-B}44}.

@subheading Dollar Local Labels
@cindex dollar local symbols

@code{@value{AS}} also supports an even more local form of local labels called
dollar labels.  These labels go out of scope (i.e., they become undefined) as
soon as a non-local label is defined.  Thus they remain valid for only a small
region of the input source code.  Normal local labels, by contrast, remain in
scope for the entire file, or until they are redefined by another occurrence of
the same local label.

Dollar labels are defined in exactly the same way as ordinary local labels,
except that they have a dollar sign suffix to their numeric value, e.g.,
@samp{@b{55$:}}.

They can also be distinguished from ordinary local labels by their transformed
names which use ASCII character @samp{\001} (control-A) as the magic character
to distinguish them from ordinary labels.  For example, the fifth definition of
@samp{6$} may be named @samp{.L6@kbd{C-A}5}.

@node Dot
@section The Special Dot Symbol

@cindex dot (symbol)
@cindex @code{.} (symbol)
@cindex current address
@cindex location counter
The special symbol @samp{.} refers to the current address that
@command{@value{AS}} is assembling into.  Thus, the expression @samp{melvin:
.long .} defines @code{melvin} to contain its own address.
Assigning a value to @code{.} is treated the same as a @code{.org}
directive.
@ifclear no-space-dir
Thus, the expression @samp{.=.+4} is the same as saying
@samp{.space 4}.
@end ifclear

@node Symbol Attributes
@section Symbol Attributes

@cindex symbol attributes
@cindex attributes, symbol

``Type''.  Depending on output format, symbols can also have auxiliary
attributes.
@ifset INTERNALS
The detailed definitions are in @file{a.out.h}.
@end ifset

If you use a symbol without defining it, @command{@value{AS}} assumes zero for
all these attributes, and probably won't warn you.  This makes the
symbol an externally defined symbol, which is generally what you
would want.

@subsection Value

@cindex value of a symbol
@cindex symbol value
The value of a symbol is (usually) 32 bits.  For a symbol which labels a
location in the text, data, bss or absolute sections the value is the
number of addresses from the start of that section to the label.
Naturally for text, data and bss sections the value of a symbol changes
as @code{@value{LD}} changes section base addresses during linking.  Absolute
symbols' values do not change during linking: that is why they are
called absolute.

The value of an undefined symbol is treated in a special way.  If it is
0 then the symbol is not defined in this assembler source file, and
@code{@value{LD}} tries to determine its value from other files linked into the
same program.  You make this kind of symbol simply by mentioning a symbol
name without defining it.  A non-zero value represents a @code{.comm}
common declaration.  The value is how much common storage to reserve, in
bytes (addresses).  The symbol refers to the first address of the
allocated storage.

@node Symbol Type
@subsection Type

@cindex type of a symbol
@cindex symbol type
The type attribute of a symbol contains relocation (section)
information, any flag settings indicating that a symbol is external, and
(optionally), other information for linkers and debuggers.  The exact
format depends on the object-code output format in use.

@cindex descriptor, of @code{a.out} symbol
This is an arbitrary 16-bit value.  You may establish a symbol's

@node Expressions
@chapter Expressions

@cindex expressions
@cindex addresses
@cindex numeric values
An @dfn{expression} specifies an address or numeric value.
Whitespace may precede and/or follow an expression.

The result of an expression must be an absolute number, or else an offset into
a particular section.  If an expression is not absolute, and there is not
enough information when @command{@value{AS}} sees the expression to know its
section, a second pass over the source program might be necessary to interpret
the expression---but the second pass is currently not implemented.
@command{@value{AS}} aborts with an error message in this situation.

@node Empty Exprs
@section Empty Expressions

@cindex empty expressions
@cindex expressions, empty
An empty expression has no value: it is just whitespace or null.
Wherever an absolute expression is required, you may omit the
expression, and @command{@value{AS}} assumes a value of (absolute) 0.  This
is compatible with other assemblers.

@node Integer Exprs
@section Integer Expressions

@cindex integer expressions
@cindex expressions, integer
An @dfn{integer expression} is one or more @emph{arguments} delimited
by @emph{operators}.

@end menu

@node Arguments
@subsection Arguments

@cindex expression arguments
@cindex arguments in expressions
@cindex operands in expressions
@cindex arithmetic operands
@dfn{Arguments} are symbols, numbers or subexpressions.  In other
contexts arguments are sometimes called ``arithmetic operands''.  In
this manual, to avoid confusing them with the ``instruction operands'' of
the machine language, we use the term ``argument'' to refer to parts of
expressions only, reserving the word ``operand'' to refer only to machine
instruction operands.

Symbols are evaluated to yield @{@var{section} @var{NNN}@} where
@var{section} is one of text, data, bss, absolute,
or undefined.  @var{NNN} is a signed, 2's complement 32 bit
integer.

Numbers are usually integers.

A number can be a flonum or bignum.  In this case, you are warned
that only the low order 32 bits are used, and @command{@value{AS}} pretends
these 32 bits are an integer.  You may write integer-manipulating
instructions that act on exotic constants, compatible with other
assemblers.

@cindex subexpressions
Subexpressions are a left parenthesis @samp{(} followed by an integer
expression, followed by a right parenthesis @samp{)}; or a prefix
operator followed by an argument.

@node Operators
@subsection Operators

@cindex operators, in expressions
@cindex arithmetic functions
@cindex functions, in expressions
@dfn{Operators} are arithmetic functions, like @code{+} or @code{%}.  Prefix
operators are followed by an argument.  Infix operators appear
between their arguments.  Operators may be preceded and/or followed by
whitespace.

@node Prefix Ops
@subsection Prefix Operator

@cindex prefix operators
@command{@value{AS}} has the following @dfn{prefix operators}.  They each take
one argument, which must be absolute.

@c the tex/end tex stuff surrounding this small table is meant to make
@c it align, on the printed page, with the similar table in the next
@c section (which is inside an enumerate).
@tex

@dfn{Negation}.  Two's complement negation.
@item ~
@dfn{Complementation}.  Bitwise not.
@end table

@tex

@node Infix Ops
@subsection Infix Operators

@cindex infix operators
@cindex operators, permitted arguments
@dfn{Infix operators} take two arguments, one on either side.  Operators
have precedence, but operations with equal precedence are performed left
to right.  Apart from @code{+} or @option{-}, both arguments must be
absolute, and the result is absolute.

@enumerate
@cindex operator precedence
@cindex precedence of operators

@table @code
@cindex addition, permitted arguments
@cindex plus, permitted arguments
@cindex arguments for addition
@item +
@dfn{Addition}.  If either argument is absolute, the result has the section of
the other argument.  You may not add together arguments from different
sections.

@cindex subtraction, permitted arguments
@cindex minus, permitted arguments
@cindex arguments for subtraction
@item -
@dfn{Subtraction}.  If the right argument is absolute, the
result has the section of the left argument.
If both arguments are in the same section, the result is absolute.
You may not subtract arguments from different sections.
@c FIXME is there still something useful to say about undefined - undefined ?

@cindex comparison expressions
@cindex expressions, comparison
@item  ==
@dfn{Is Equal To}
@item <>
@itemx !=
@dfn{Is Not Equal To}
@item <
@dfn{Is Less Than}
@item >
@dfn{Is Greater Than}
@item >=
@dfn{Is Greater Than Or Equal To}
@item <=
@dfn{Is Less Than Or Equal To}

The comparison operators can be used as infix operators.  A true results has a
value of -1 whereas a false result has a value of 0.   Note, these operators
perform signed comparisons.
@end table

@item Lowest Precedence

@table @code
@item &&
@dfn{Logical And}.

@item ||
@dfn{Logical Or}.

These two logical operations can be used to combine the results of sub
expressions.  Note, unlike the comparison operators a true result returns a
value of 1 but a false results does still return 0.  Also note that the logical
or operator has a slightly lower precedence than logical and.

@end table
@end enumerate

In short, it's only meaningful to add or subtract the @emph{offsets} in an
address; you can only have a defined section in one of the two arguments.

@cindex machine independent directives
All assembler directives have names that begin with a period (@samp{.}).
The rest of the name is letters, usually in lower case.

This chapter discusses directives that are available regardless of the

@node Abort
@section @code{.abort}

@cindex @code{abort} directive
@cindex stopping the assembly
This directive stops the assembly immediately.  It is for
compatibility with other assemblers.  The original idea was that the
assembly language source would be piped into the assembler.  If the sender
of the source quit, it could use this directive tells @command{@value{AS}} to
quit also.  One day @code{.abort} will not be supported.

@ifset COFF
@node ABORT (COFF)
@section @code{.ABORT} (COFF)

@cindex @code{ABORT} directive
When producing COFF output, @command{@value{AS}} accepts this directive as a
synonym for @samp{.abort}.

@ifset BOUT
When producing @code{b.out} output, @command{@value{AS}} accepts this directive,
but ignores it.
@end ifset
@end ifset

@node Align
@section @code{.align @var{abs-expr}, @var{abs-expr}, @var{abs-expr}}

@cindex padding the location counter
@cindex @code{align} directive
Pad the location counter (in the current subsection) to a particular storage
boundary.  The first expression (which must be absolute) is the alignment
required, as described below.

The second expression (also absolute) gives the fill value to be stored in the
padding bytes.  It (and the comma) may be omitted.  If it is omitted, the
padding bytes are normally zero.  However, on some systems, if the section is
marked as containing code and the fill value is omitted, the space is filled
with no-op instructions.

The third expression is also absolute, and is also optional.  If it is present,
it is the maximum number of bytes that should be skipped by this alignment
directive.  If doing the alignment would require skipping more bytes than the
specified maximum, then the alignment is not done at all.  You can omit the
fill value (the second argument) entirely by simply using two commas after the
required alignment; this can be useful if you want the alignment to be filled
with no-op instructions when appropriate.

The way the required alignment is specified varies from system to system.
For the arc, hppa, i386 using ELF, i860, iq2000, m68k, or1k,
s390, sparc, tic4x, tic80 and xtensa, the first expression is the
alignment request in bytes.  For example @samp{.align 8} advances
the location counter until it is a multiple of 8.  If the location counter
is already a multiple of 8, no change is needed.  For the tic54x, the
first expression is the alignment request in words.

For other systems, including ppc, i386 using a.out format, arm and
strongarm, it is the
number of low-order zero bits the location counter must have after
advancement.  For example @samp{.align 3} advances the location
counter until it a multiple of 8.  If the location counter is already a
multiple of 8, no change is needed.

This inconsistency is due to the different behaviors of the various
native assemblers for these systems which GAS must emulate.
GAS also provides @code{.balign} and @code{.p2align} directives,
described later, which have a consistent behavior across all
architectures (but are specific to GAS).

@node Altmacro
@section @code{.altmacro}
Enable alternate macro mode, enabling:

@ftable @code
@item LOCAL @var{name} [ , @dots{} ]
One additional directive, @code{LOCAL}, is available.  It is used to
generate a string replacement for each of the @var{name} arguments, and
replace any instances of @var{name} in each macro expansion.  The
replacement string is unique in the assembly, and different for each
separate macro expansion.  @code{LOCAL} allows you to write macros that
define symbols, without fear of conflict between separate macro expansions.

@item String delimiters
You can write strings delimited in these other ways besides
@code{"@var{string}"}:

@table @code
@item '@var{string}'
You can delimit strings with single-quote characters.

@item <@var{string}>
You can delimit strings with matching angle brackets.
@end table

@item single-character string escape
To include any single character literally in a string (even if the
character would otherwise have some special meaning), you can prefix the
character with @samp{!} (an exclamation mark).  For example, you can
write @samp{<4.3 !> 5.4!!>} to get the literal text @samp{4.3 > 5.4!}.

@item Expression results as strings
You can write @samp{%@var{expr}} to evaluate the expression @var{expr}
and use the result as a string.
@end ftable

@node Ascii
@section @code{.ascii "@var{string}"}@dots{}

@cindex @code{ascii} directive
@cindex string literals
@code{.ascii} expects zero or more string literals (@pxref{Strings})
separated by commas.  It assembles each string (with no automatic
trailing zero byte) into consecutive addresses.

@node Asciz
@section @code{.asciz "@var{string}"}@dots{}

@cindex @code{asciz} directive
@cindex zero-terminated strings
@cindex null-terminated strings
@code{.asciz} is just like @code{.ascii}, but each string is followed by
a zero byte.  The ``z'' in @samp{.asciz} stands for ``zero''.

@node Balign
@section @code{.balign[wl] @var{abs-expr}, @var{abs-expr}, @var{abs-expr}}

@cindex padding the location counter given number of bytes
@cindex @code{balign} directive
Pad the location counter (in the current subsection) to a particular
storage boundary.  The first expression (which must be absolute) is the
alignment request in bytes.  For example @samp{.balign 8} advances
the location counter until it is a multiple of 8.  If the location counter
is already a multiple of 8, no change is needed.

The second expression (also absolute) gives the fill value to be stored in the
padding bytes.  It (and the comma) may be omitted.  If it is omitted, the
padding bytes are normally zero.  However, on some systems, if the section is
marked as containing code and the fill value is omitted, the space is filled
with no-op instructions.

The third expression is also absolute, and is also optional.  If it is present,
it is the maximum number of bytes that should be skipped by this alignment
directive.  If doing the alignment would require skipping more bytes than the
specified maximum, then the alignment is not done at all.  You can omit the
fill value (the second argument) entirely by simply using two commas after the
required alignment; this can be useful if you want the alignment to be filled
with no-op instructions when appropriate.

@cindex @code{balignw} directive
@cindex @code{balignl} directive
The @code{.balignw} and @code{.balignl} directives are variants of the
@code{.balign} directive.  The @code{.balignw} directive treats the fill
pattern as a two byte word value.  The @code{.balignl} directives treats the
fill pattern as a four byte longword value.  For example, @code{.balignw
4,0x368d} will align to a multiple of 4.  If it skips two bytes, they will be
filled in with the value 0x368d (the exact placement of the bytes depends upon
the endianness of the processor).  If it skips 1 or 3 bytes, the fill value is
undefined.

@node Bundle directives
@section @code{.bundle_align_mode @var{abs-expr}}
@cindex @code{bundle_align_mode} directive
@cindex bundle
@cindex instruction bundle
@cindex aligned instruction bundle
@code{.bundle_align_mode} enables or disables @dfn{aligned instruction
bundle} mode.  In this mode, sequences of adjacent instructions are grouped
into fixed-sized @dfn{bundles}.  If the argument is zero, this mode is
disabled (which is the default state).  If the argument it not zero, it
gives the size of an instruction bundle as a power of two (as for the
@code{.p2align} directive, @pxref{P2align}).

For some targets, it's an ABI requirement that no instruction may span a
certain aligned boundary.  A @dfn{bundle} is simply a sequence of
instructions that starts on an aligned boundary.  For example, if
@var{abs-expr} is @code{5} then the bundle size is 32, so each aligned
chunk of 32 bytes is a bundle.  When aligned instruction bundle mode is in
effect, no single instruction may span a boundary between bundles.  If an
instruction would start too close to the end of a bundle for the length of
that particular instruction to fit within the bundle, then the space at the
end of that bundle is filled with no-op instructions so the instruction
starts in the next bundle.  As a corollary, it's an error if any single
instruction's encoding is longer than the bundle size.

@section @code{.bundle_lock} and @code{.bundle_unlock}
@cindex @code{bundle_lock} directive
@cindex @code{bundle_unlock} directive
The @code{.bundle_lock} and directive @code{.bundle_unlock} directives
allow explicit control over instruction bundle padding.  These directives
are only valid when @code{.bundle_align_mode} has been used to enable
aligned instruction bundle mode.  It's an error if they appear when
@code{.bundle_align_mode} has not been used at all, or when the last
directive was @w{@code{.bundle_align_mode 0}}.

@cindex bundle-locked
For some targets, it's an ABI requirement that certain instructions may
appear only as part of specified permissible sequences of multiple
instructions, all within the same bundle.  A pair of @code{.bundle_lock}
and @code{.bundle_unlock} directives define a @dfn{bundle-locked}
instruction sequence.  For purposes of aligned instruction bundle mode, a
sequence starting with @code{.bundle_lock} and ending with
@code{.bundle_unlock} is treated as a single instruction.  That is, the
entire sequence must fit into a single bundle and may not span a bundle
boundary.  If necessary, no-op instructions will be inserted before the
first instruction of the sequence so that the whole sequence starts on an
aligned bundle boundary.  It's an error if the sequence is longer than the
bundle size.

For convenience when using @code{.bundle_lock} and @code{.bundle_unlock}
inside assembler macros (@pxref{Macro}), bundle-locked sequences may be
nested.  That is, a second @code{.bundle_lock} directive before the next
@code{.bundle_unlock} directive has no effect except that it must be
matched by another closing @code{.bundle_unlock} so that there is the
same number of @code{.bundle_lock} and @code{.bundle_unlock} directives.

@node Byte
@section @code{.byte @var{expressions}}

@cindex @code{byte} directive
@cindex integers, one byte
@code{.byte} expects zero or more expressions, separated by commas.
Each expression is assembled into the next byte.

@node CFI directives
@section @code{.cfi_sections @var{section_list}}
@cindex @code{cfi_sections} directive
@code{.cfi_sections} may be used to specify whether CFI directives
should emit @code{.eh_frame} section and/or @code{.debug_frame} section.
If @var{section_list} is @code{.eh_frame}, @code{.eh_frame} is emitted,
if @var{section_list} is @code{.debug_frame}, @code{.debug_frame} is emitted.
To emit both use @code{.eh_frame, .debug_frame}.  The default if this
directive is not used is @code{.cfi_sections .eh_frame}.

@section @code{.cfi_startproc [simple]}
@cindex @code{cfi_startproc} directive
@code{.cfi_startproc} is used at the beginning of each function that
should have an entry in @code{.eh_frame}. It initializes some internal
data structures. Don't forget to close the function by
@code{.cfi_endproc}.

Unless @code{.cfi_startproc} is used along with parameter @code{simple}
it also emits some architecture dependent initial CFI instructions.

@section @code{.cfi_endproc}
@cindex @code{cfi_endproc} directive
@code{.cfi_endproc} is used at the end of a function where it closes its
unwind entry previously opened by
@code{.cfi_startproc}, and emits it to @code{.eh_frame}.

@section @code{.cfi_personality @var{encoding} [, @var{exp}]}
@code{.cfi_personality} defines personality routine and its encoding.
@var{encoding} must be a constant determining how the personality
should be encoded.  If it is 255 (@code{DW_EH_PE_omit}), second
argument is not present, otherwise second argument should be
a constant or a symbol name.  When using indirect encodings,
the symbol provided should be the location where personality
can be loaded from, not the personality routine itself.
The default after @code{.cfi_startproc} is @code{.cfi_personality 0xff},
no personality routine.

@section @code{.cfi_lsda @var{encoding} [, @var{exp}]}
@code{.cfi_lsda} defines LSDA and its encoding.
@var{encoding} must be a constant determining how the LSDA
should be encoded.  If it is 255 (@code{DW_EH_PE_omit}), second
argument is not present, otherwise second argument should be a constant
or a symbol name.  The default after @code{.cfi_startproc} is @code{.cfi_lsda 0xff},
no LSDA.

@section @code{.cfi_def_cfa @var{register}, @var{offset}}
@code{.cfi_def_cfa} defines a rule for computing CFA as: @i{take
address from @var{register} and add @var{offset} to it}.

@section @code{.cfi_def_cfa_register @var{register}}
@code{.cfi_def_cfa_register} modifies a rule for computing CFA. From
now on @var{register} will be used instead of the old one. Offset
remains the same.

@section @code{.cfi_def_cfa_offset @var{offset}}
@code{.cfi_def_cfa_offset} modifies a rule for computing CFA. Register
remains the same, but @var{offset} is new. Note that it is the
absolute offset that will be added to a defined register to compute
CFA address.

@section @code{.cfi_adjust_cfa_offset @var{offset}}
Same as @code{.cfi_def_cfa_offset} but @var{offset} is a relative
value that is added/substracted from the previous offset.

@section @code{.cfi_offset @var{register}, @var{offset}}
Previous value of @var{register} is saved at offset @var{offset} from
CFA.

@section @code{.cfi_rel_offset @var{register}, @var{offset}}
Previous value of @var{register} is saved at offset @var{offset} from
the current CFA register.  This is transformed to @code{.cfi_offset}
using the known displacement of the CFA register from the CFA.
This is often easier to use, because the number will match the
code it's annotating.

@section @code{.cfi_register @var{register1}, @var{register2}}
Previous value of @var{register1} is saved in register @var{register2}.

@section @code{.cfi_restore @var{register}}
@code{.cfi_restore} says that the rule for @var{register} is now the
same as it was at the beginning of the function, after all initial
instruction added by @code{.cfi_startproc} were executed.

@section @code{.cfi_undefined @var{register}}
From now on the previous value of @var{register} can't be restored anymore.

@section @code{.cfi_same_value @var{register}}
Current value of @var{register} is the same like in the previous frame,
i.e. no restoration needed.

@section @code{.cfi_remember_state},
First save all current rules for all registers by @code{.cfi_remember_state},
then totally screw them up by subsequent @code{.cfi_*} directives and when
everything is hopelessly bad, use @code{.cfi_restore_state} to restore
the previous saved state.

@section @code{.cfi_return_column @var{register}}
Change return column @var{register}, i.e. the return address is either
directly in @var{register} or can be accessed by rules for @var{register}.

@section @code{.cfi_signal_frame}
Mark current function as signal trampoline.

@section @code{.cfi_window_save}
SPARC register window has been saved.

@section @code{.cfi_escape} @var{expression}[, @dots{}]
Allows the user to add arbitrary bytes to the unwind info.  One
might use this to add OS-specific CFI opcodes, or generic CFI
opcodes that GAS does not yet support.

@section @code{.cfi_val_encoded_addr @var{register}, @var{encoding}, @var{label}}
The current value of @var{register} is @var{label}.  The value of @var{label}
will be encoded in the output file according to @var{encoding}; see the
description of @code{.cfi_personality} for details on this encoding.

The usefulness of equating a register to a fixed label is probably
limited to the return address register.  Here, it can be useful to
mark a code segment that has only one return address which is reached
by a direct branch and no copy of the return address exists in memory
or another register.

@node Comm
@section @code{.comm @var{symbol} , @var{length} }

@cindex @code{comm} directive
@cindex symbol, common
@code{.comm} declares a common symbol named @var{symbol}.  When linking, a
common symbol in one object file may be merged with a defined or common symbol
of the same name in another object file.  If @code{@value{LD}} does not see a
definition for the symbol--just one or more common symbols--then it will
allocate @var{length} bytes of uninitialized memory.  @var{length} must be an
absolute expression.  If @code{@value{LD}} sees multiple common symbols with
the same name, and they do not all have the same size, it will allocate space
using the largest size.

When using ELF or (as a GNU extension) PE, the @code{.comm} directive takes
an optional third argument.  This is the desired alignment of the symbol,
specified for ELF as a byte boundary (for example, an alignment of 16 means
that the least significant 4 bits of the address should be zero), and for PE
as a power of two (for example, an alignment of 5 means aligned to a 32-byte
boundary).  The alignment must be an absolute expression, and it must be a
power of two.  If @code{@value{LD}} allocates uninitialized memory for the
common symbol, it will use the alignment when placing the symbol.  If no
alignment is specified, @command{@value{AS}} will set the alignment to the
largest power of two less than or equal to the size of the symbol, up to a
maximum of 16 on ELF, or the default section alignment of 4 on PE@footnote{This
is not the same as the executable image file alignment controlled by @code{@value{LD}}'s
@samp{--section-alignment} option; image file sections in PE are aligned to
multiples of 4096, which is far too large an alignment for ordinary variables.
It is rather the default alignment for (non-debug) sections within object
(@samp{*.o}) files, which are less strictly aligned.}.

@ifset HPPA
The syntax for @code{.comm} differs slightly on the HPPA.  The syntax is
@samp{@var{symbol} .comm, @var{length}}; @var{symbol} is optional.
@end ifset

@node Data
@section @code{.data @var{subsection}}

@cindex @code{data} directive
@code{.data} tells @command{@value{AS}} to assemble the following statements onto the
end of the data subsection numbered @var{subsection} (which is an
absolute expression).  If @var{subsection} is omitted, it defaults
to zero.

@ifset COFF
@node Def
@section @code{.def @var{name}}

@cindex @code{def} directive
@cindex COFF symbols, debugging
@cindex debugging COFF symbols
Begin defining debugging information for a symbol @var{name}; the
definition extends until the @code{.endef} directive is encountered.
@ifset BOUT

This directive is only observed when @command{@value{AS}} is configured for COFF
format output; when producing @code{b.out}, @samp{.def} is recognized,
but ignored.
@end ifset
@end ifset

@ifset aout-bout
@node Desc
@section @code{.desc @var{symbol}, @var{abs-expression}}

@cindex @code{desc} directive
@cindex COFF symbol descriptor
@cindex symbol descriptor, COFF
This directive sets the descriptor of the symbol (@pxref{Symbol Attributes})
to the low 16 bits of an absolute expression.

@ifset COFF
The @samp{.desc} directive is not available when @command{@value{AS}} is
configured for COFF output; it is only for @code{a.out} or @code{b.out}
object format.  For the sake of compatibility, @command{@value{AS}} accepts
it, but produces no output, when configured for COFF.
@end ifset
@end ifset

@ifset COFF
@node Dim
@section @code{.dim}

@cindex @code{dim} directive
@cindex COFF auxiliary symbol information
@cindex auxiliary symbol information, COFF
This directive is generated by compilers to include auxiliary debugging
information in the symbol table.  It is only permitted inside
@code{.def}/@code{.endef} pairs.
@ifset BOUT

@samp{.dim} is only meaningful when generating COFF format output; when
@command{@value{AS}} is generating @code{b.out}, it accepts this directive but
ignores it.
@end ifset
@end ifset

@node Double
@section @code{.double @var{flonums}}

@cindex @code{double} directive
@cindex floating point numbers (double)
@code{.double} expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas.  It
assembles floating point numbers.
The exact kind of floating point numbers emitted depends on how
@command{@value{AS}} is configured.  @xref{Machine Dependencies}.

@node Eject
@section @code{.eject}

@cindex @code{eject} directive
@cindex new page, in listings
@cindex page, in listings
@cindex listing control: new page
Force a page break at this point, when generating assembly listings.

@node Else
@section @code{.else}

@cindex @code{else} directive
@code{.else} is part of the @command{@value{AS}} support for conditional
assembly; see @ref{If,,@code{.if}}.  It marks the beginning of a section
of code to be assembled if the condition for the preceding @code{.if}
was false.

@node Elseif
@section @code{.elseif}

@cindex @code{elseif} directive
@code{.elseif} is part of the @command{@value{AS}} support for conditional
assembly; see @ref{If,,@code{.if}}.  It is shorthand for beginning a new
@code{.if} block that would otherwise fill the entire @code{.else} section.

@node End
@section @code{.end}

@cindex @code{end} directive
@code{.end} marks the end of the assembly file.  @command{@value{AS}} does not
process anything in the file past the @code{.end} directive.

@ifset COFF
@node Endef
@section @code{.endef}

@cindex @code{endef} directive
This directive flags the end of a symbol definition begun with
@code{.def}.
@ifset BOUT

@samp{.endef} is only meaningful when generating COFF format output; if
@command{@value{AS}} is configured to generate @code{b.out}, it accepts this
directive but ignores it.
@end ifset
@end ifset

@node Endfunc
@section @code{.endfunc}
@cindex @code{endfunc} directive
@code{.endfunc} marks the end of a function specified with @code{.func}.

@node Endif
@section @code{.endif}

@cindex @code{endif} directive
@code{.endif} is part of the @command{@value{AS}} support for conditional assembly;
it marks the end of a block of code that is only assembled
conditionally.  @xref{If,,@code{.if}}.

@node Equ
@section @code{.equ @var{symbol}, @var{expression}}

@cindex @code{equ} directive
@cindex assigning values to symbols
@cindex symbols, assigning values to
This directive sets the value of @var{symbol} to @var{expression}.
It is synonymous with @samp{.set}; see @ref{Set,,@code{.set}}.

@ifset HPPA
The syntax for @code{equ} on the HPPA is
@samp{@var{symbol} .equ @var{expression}}.
@end ifset

@ifset Z80
The syntax for @code{equ} on the Z80 is
@samp{@var{symbol} equ @var{expression}}.
On the Z80 it is an eror if @var{symbol} is already defined,
but the symbol is not protected from later redefinition.
Compare @ref{Equiv}.
@end ifset

@node Equiv
@section @code{.equiv @var{symbol}, @var{expression}}
@cindex @code{equiv} directive
The @code{.equiv} directive is like @code{.equ} and @code{.set}, except that
the assembler will signal an error if @var{symbol} is already defined.  Note a
symbol which has been referenced but not actually defined is considered to be
undefined.

Except for the contents of the error message, this is roughly equivalent to
@example
.ifdef SYM
.err
.endif
.equ SYM,VAL
@end example
plus it protects the symbol from later redefinition.

@node Eqv
@section @code{.eqv @var{symbol}, @var{expression}}
@cindex @code{eqv} directive
The @code{.eqv} directive is like @code{.equiv}, but no attempt is made to
evaluate the expression or any part of it immediately.  Instead each time
the resulting symbol is used in an expression, a snapshot of its current
value is taken.

@node Err
@section @code{.err}
@cindex @code{err} directive
If @command{@value{AS}} assembles a @code{.err} directive, it will print an error
message and, unless the @option{-Z} option was used, it will not generate an
object file.  This can be used to signal an error in conditionally compiled code.

@node Error
@section @code{.error "@var{string}"}
@cindex error directive

Similarly to @code{.err}, this directive emits an error, but you can specify a
string that will be emitted as the error message.  If you don't specify the
message, it defaults to @code{".error directive invoked in source file"}.
@xref{Errors, ,Error and Warning Messages}.

@example
 .error "This code has not been assembled and tested."
@end example

@node Exitm
@section @code{.exitm}
Exit early from the current macro definition.  @xref{Macro}.

@node Extern
@section @code{.extern}

@cindex @code{extern} directive
@code{.extern} is accepted in the source program---for compatibility
with other assemblers---but it is ignored.  @command{@value{AS}} treats
all undefined symbols as external.

@node Fail
@section @code{.fail @var{expression}}

@cindex @code{fail} directive
Generates an error or a warning.  If the value of the @var{expression} is 500
or more, @command{@value{AS}} will print a warning message.  If the value is less
than 500, @command{@value{AS}} will print an error message.  The message will
include the value of @var{expression}.  This can occasionally be useful inside
complex nested macros or conditional assembly.

@node File
@section @code{.file}
@cindex @code{file} directive

@ifclear no-file-dir
There are two different versions of the @code{.file} directive.  Targets
that support DWARF2 line number information use the DWARF2 version of
@code{.file}.  Other targets use the default version.

@subheading Default Version

@cindex logical file name
@cindex file name, logical
This version of the @code{.file} directive tells @command{@value{AS}} that we
are about to start a new logical file.  The syntax is:

@example
.file @var{string}
@end example

@var{string} is the new file name.  In general, the filename is
recognized whether or not it is surrounded by quotes @samp{"}; but if you wish
to specify an empty file name, you must give the quotes--@code{""}.  This
statement may go away in future: it is only recognized to be compatible with
old @command{@value{AS}} programs.

@subheading DWARF2 Version
@end ifclear

When emitting DWARF2 line number information, @code{.file} assigns filenames
to the @code{.debug_line} file name table.  The syntax is:

@example
.file @var{fileno} @var{filename}
@end example

The @var{fileno} operand should be a unique positive integer to use as the
index of the entry in the table.  The @var{filename} operand is a C string
literal.

The detail of filename indices is exposed to the user because the filename
table is shared with the @code{.debug_info} section of the DWARF2 debugging
information, and thus the user must know the exact indices that table
entries will have.

@node Fill
@section @code{.fill @var{repeat} , @var{size} , @var{value}}

@cindex @code{fill} directive
@cindex writing patterns in memory
@cindex patterns, writing in memory
@var{repeat}, @var{size} and @var{value} are absolute expressions.
This emits @var{repeat} copies of @var{size} bytes.  @var{Repeat}
may be zero or more.  @var{Size} may be zero or more, but if it is
more than 8, then it is deemed to have the value 8, compatible with
other people's assemblers.  The contents of each @var{repeat} bytes
is taken from an 8-byte number.  The highest order 4 bytes are
zero.  The lowest order 4 bytes are @var{value} rendered in the
byte-order of an integer on the computer @command{@value{AS}} is assembling for.
Each @var{size} bytes in a repetition is taken from the lowest order
@var{size} bytes of this number.  Again, this bizarre behavior is
compatible with other people's assemblers.

@var{size} and @var{value} are optional.
If the second comma and @var{value} are absent, @var{value} is
assumed zero.  If the first comma and following tokens are absent,
@var{size} is assumed to be 1.

@node Float
@section @code{.float @var{flonums}}

@cindex floating point numbers (single)
@cindex @code{float} directive
This directive assembles zero or more flonums, separated by commas.  It
has the same effect as @code{.single}.
The exact kind of floating point numbers emitted depends on how
@command{@value{AS}} is configured.
@xref{Machine Dependencies}.

@node Func
@section @code{.func @var{name}[,@var{label}]}
@cindex @code{func} directive
@code{.func} emits debugging information to denote function @var{name}, and
is ignored unless the file is assembled with debugging enabled.
Only @samp{--gstabs[+]} is currently supported.
@var{label} is the entry point of the function and if omitted @var{name}
prepended with the @samp{leading char} is used.
@samp{leading char} is usually @code{_} or nothing, depending on the target.
All functions are currently defined to have @code{void} return type.
The function must be terminated with @code{.endfunc}.

@node Global
@section @code{.global @var{symbol}}, @code{.globl @var{symbol}}

@cindex @code{global} directive
@cindex symbol, making visible to linker
@code{.global} makes the symbol visible to @code{@value{LD}}.  If you define
@var{symbol} in your partial program, its value is made available to
other partial programs that are linked with it.  Otherwise,
@var{symbol} takes its attributes from a symbol of the same name
from another file linked into the same program.

Both spellings (@samp{.globl} and @samp{.global}) are accepted, for
compatibility with other assemblers.

@ifset HPPA
On the HPPA, @code{.global} is not always enough to make it accessible to other
partial programs.  You may need the HPPA-only @code{.EXPORT} directive as well.
@xref{HPPA Directives, ,HPPA Assembler Directives}.
@end ifset

@ifset ELF
@node Gnu_attribute
@section @code{.gnu_attribute @var{tag},@var{value}}
Record a @sc{gnu} object attribute for this file.  @xref{Object Attributes}.

@node Hidden
@section @code{.hidden @var{names}}

@cindex @code{hidden} directive
@cindex visibility
This is one of the ELF visibility directives.  The other two are
@code{.internal} (@pxref{Internal,,@code{.internal}}) and
@code{.protected} (@pxref{Protected,,@code{.protected}}).

This directive overrides the named symbols default visibility (which is set by
their binding: local, global or weak).  The directive sets the visibility to
@code{hidden} which means that the symbols are not visible to other components.
Such symbols are always considered to be @code{protected} as well.
@end ifset

@node hword
@section @code{.hword @var{expressions}}

@cindex @code{hword} directive
@cindex integers, 16-bit
@cindex numbers, 16-bit
@cindex sixteen bit integers
This expects zero or more @var{expressions}, and emits
a 16 bit number for each.

This directive is a synonym for @samp{.short}; depending on the target
architecture, it may also be a synonym for @samp{.word}.

@node Ident
@section @code{.ident}

@cindex @code{ident} directive

This directive is used by some assemblers to place tags in object files.  The
behavior of this directive varies depending on the target.  When using the
a.out object file format, @command{@value{AS}} simply accepts the directive for
source-file compatibility with existing assemblers, but does not emit anything
for it.  When using COFF, comments are emitted to the @code{.comment} or
@code{.rdata} section, depending on the target.  When using ELF, comments are
emitted to the @code{.comment} section.

@node If
@section @code{.if @var{absolute expression}}

@cindex conditional assembly
@cindex @code{if} directive
@code{.if} marks the beginning of a section of code which is only
considered part of the source program being assembled if the argument
(which must be an @var{absolute expression}) is non-zero.  The end of
the conditional section of code must be marked by @code{.endif}
(@pxref{Endif,,@code{.endif}}); optionally, you may include code for the
alternative condition, flagged by @code{.else} (@pxref{Else,,@code{.else}}).
If you have several conditions to check, @code{.elseif} may be used to avoid
nesting blocks if/else within each subsequent @code{.else} block.

The following variants of @code{.if} are also supported:
@table @code
@cindex @code{ifdef} directive
@item .ifdef @var{symbol}
Assembles the following section of code if the specified @var{symbol}
has been defined.  Note a symbol which has been referenced but not yet defined
is considered to be undefined.

@cindex @code{ifb} directive
@item .ifb @var{text}
Assembles the following section of code if the operand is blank (empty).

@cindex @code{ifc} directive
@item .ifc @var{string1},@var{string2}
Assembles the following section of code if the two strings are the same.  The
strings may be optionally quoted with single quotes.  If they are not quoted,
the first string stops at the first comma, and the second string stops at the
end of the line.  Strings which contain whitespace should be quoted.  The
string comparison is case sensitive.

@cindex @code{ifeq} directive
@item .ifeq @var{absolute expression}
Assembles the following section of code if the argument is zero.

@cindex @code{ifeqs} directive
@item .ifeqs @var{string1},@var{string2}
Another form of @code{.ifc}.  The strings must be quoted using double quotes.

@cindex @code{ifge} directive
@item .ifge @var{absolute expression}
Assembles the following section of code if the argument is greater than or
equal to zero.

@cindex @code{ifgt} directive
@item .ifgt @var{absolute expression}
Assembles the following section of code if the argument is greater than zero.

@cindex @code{ifle} directive
@item .ifle @var{absolute expression}
Assembles the following section of code if the argument is less than or equal
to zero.

@cindex @code{iflt} directive
@item .iflt @var{absolute expression}
Assembles the following section of code if the argument is less than zero.

@cindex @code{ifnb} directive
@item .ifnb @var{text}
Like @code{.ifb}, but the sense of the test is reversed: this assembles the
following section of code if the operand is non-blank (non-empty).

@cindex @code{ifnc} directive
@item .ifnc @var{string1},@var{string2}.
Like @code{.ifc}, but the sense of the test is reversed: this assembles the
following section of code if the two strings are not the same.

@cindex @code{ifndef} directive
@cindex @code{ifnotdef} directive
@item .ifndef @var{symbol}
@itemx .ifnotdef @var{symbol}
Assembles the following section of code if the specified @var{symbol}
has not been defined.  Both spelling variants are equivalent.  Note a symbol
which has been referenced but not yet defined is considered to be undefined.

@cindex @code{ifne} directive
@item .ifne @var{absolute expression}
Assembles the following section of code if the argument is not equal to zero
(in other words, this is equivalent to @code{.if}).

@cindex @code{ifnes} directive
@item .ifnes @var{string1},@var{string2}
Like @code{.ifeqs}, but the sense of the test is reversed: this assembles the
following section of code if the two strings are not the same.

@node Incbin
@section @code{.incbin "@var{file}"[,@var{skip}[,@var{count}]]}

@cindex @code{incbin} directive
@cindex binary files, including
The @code{incbin} directive includes @var{file} verbatim at the current
location. You can control the search paths used with the @samp{-I} command-line
option (@pxref{Invoking,,Command-Line Options}).  Quotation marks are required
around @var{file}.

The @var{skip} argument skips a number of bytes from the start of the
@var{file}.  The @var{count} argument indicates the maximum number of bytes to
read.  Note that the data is not aligned in any way, so it is the user's
responsibility to make sure that proper alignment is provided both before and
after the @code{incbin} directive.

@node Include
@section @code{.include "@var{file}"}

@cindex @code{include} directive
@cindex supporting files, including
@cindex files, including
This directive provides a way to include supporting files at specified
points in your source program.  The code from @var{file} is assembled as
if it followed the point of the @code{.include}; when the end of the
included file is reached, assembly of the original file continues.  You
can control the search paths used with the @samp{-I} command-line option
(@pxref{Invoking,,Command-Line Options}).  Quotation marks are required
around @var{file}.

@node Int
@section @code{.int @var{expressions}}

@cindex @code{int} directive
@cindex integers, 32-bit
Expect zero or more @var{expressions}, of any section, separated by commas.
For each expression, emit a number that, at run time, is the value of that
expression.  The byte order and bit size of the number depends on what kind
of target the assembly is for.


@ifset ELF
@node Internal
@section @code{.internal @var{names}}

@cindex @code{internal} directive
@cindex visibility
This is one of the ELF visibility directives.  The other two are
@code{.hidden} (@pxref{Hidden,,@code{.hidden}}) and
@code{.protected} (@pxref{Protected,,@code{.protected}}).

This directive overrides the named symbols default visibility (which is set by
their binding: local, global or weak).  The directive sets the visibility to
@code{internal} which means that the symbols are considered to be @code{hidden}
(i.e., not visible to other components), and that some extra, processor specific
processing must also be performed upon the  symbols as well.
@end ifset

@node Irp
@section @code{.irp @var{symbol},@var{values}}@dots{}

@cindex @code{irp} directive
Evaluate a sequence of statements assigning different values to @var{symbol}.
The sequence of statements starts at the @code{.irp} directive, and is
terminated by an @code{.endr} directive.  For each @var{value}, @var{symbol} is
set to @var{value}, and the sequence of statements is assembled.  If no
@var{value} is listed, the sequence of statements is assembled once, with
@var{symbol} set to the null string.  To refer to @var{symbol} within the
sequence of statements, use @var{\symbol}.

For example, assembling

@example
        .irp    param,1,2,3
        move    d\param,sp@@-
        .endr
@end example

is equivalent to assembling

@example
        move    d1,sp@@-
        move    d2,sp@@-
        move    d3,sp@@-
@end example

For some caveats with the spelling of @var{symbol}, see also @ref{Macro}.

@node Irpc
@section @code{.irpc @var{symbol},@var{values}}@dots{}

@cindex @code{irpc} directive
Evaluate a sequence of statements assigning different values to @var{symbol}.
The sequence of statements starts at the @code{.irpc} directive, and is
terminated by an @code{.endr} directive.  For each character in @var{value},
@var{symbol} is set to the character, and the sequence of statements is
assembled.  If no @var{value} is listed, the sequence of statements is
assembled once, with @var{symbol} set to the null string.  To refer to
@var{symbol} within the sequence of statements, use @var{\symbol}.

For example, assembling

@example
        .irpc    param,123
        move    d\param,sp@@-
        .endr
@end example

is equivalent to assembling

@example
        move    d1,sp@@-
        move    d2,sp@@-
        move    d3,sp@@-
@end example

@node Lcomm
@section @code{.lcomm @var{symbol} , @var{length}}

@cindex @code{lcomm} directive
@cindex local common symbols
@cindex symbols, local common
Reserve @var{length} (an absolute expression) bytes for a local common
denoted by @var{symbol}.  The section and value of @var{symbol} are
those of the new local common.  The addresses are allocated in the bss
section, so that at run-time the bytes start off zeroed.  @var{Symbol}
is not declared global (@pxref{Global,,@code{.global}}), so is normally
not visible to @code{@value{LD}}.

Some targets permit a third argument to be used with @code{.lcomm}.  This
argument specifies the desired alignment of the symbol in the bss section.

@ifset HPPA
The syntax for @code{.lcomm} differs slightly on the HPPA.  The syntax is
@samp{@var{symbol} .lcomm, @var{length}}; @var{symbol} is optional.
@end ifset

@node Lflags
@section @code{.lflags}

@cindex @code{lflags} directive (ignored)
@command{@value{AS}} accepts this directive, for compatibility with other
assemblers, but ignores it.

@ifclear no-line-dir
@node Line
@section @code{.line @var{line-number}}

@cindex @code{line} directive
@cindex logical line number
@ifset aout-bout
Change the logical line number.  @var{line-number} must be an absolute
expression.  The next line has that logical line number.  Therefore any other
statements on the current line (after a statement separator character) are
reported as on logical line number @var{line-number} @minus{} 1.  One day
@command{@value{AS}} will no longer support this directive: it is recognized only
for compatibility with existing assembler programs.
@end ifset

Even though this is a directive associated with the @code{a.out} or
@code{b.out} object-code formats, @command{@value{AS}} still recognizes it
when producing COFF output, and treats @samp{.line} as though it
were the COFF @samp{.ln} @emph{if} it is found outside a
@code{.def}/@code{.endef} pair.

Inside a @code{.def}, @samp{.line} is, instead, one of the directives
used by compilers to generate auxiliary symbol information for
debugging.
@end ifclear

@node Linkonce
@section @code{.linkonce [@var{type}]}
@cindex COMDAT
@cindex @code{linkonce} directive
@cindex common sections
Mark the current section so that the linker only includes a single copy of it.
This may be used to include the same section in several different object files,
but ensure that the linker will only include it once in the final output file.
The @code{.linkonce} pseudo-op must be used for each instance of the section.
Duplicate sections are detected based on the section name, so it should be
unique.

This directive is only supported by a few object file formats; as of this
writing, the only object file format which supports it is the Portable
Executable format used on Windows NT.

The @var{type} argument is optional.  If specified, it must be one of the
following strings.  For example:
@example
.linkonce same_size
@end example
Not all types may be supported on all object file formats.

@table @code
@item discard
Silently discard duplicate sections.  This is the default.

@item one_only
Warn if there are duplicate sections, but still keep only one copy.

@item same_size
Warn if any of the duplicates have different sizes.

@item same_contents
Warn if any of the duplicates do not have exactly the same contents.
@end table

@node List
@section @code{.list}

@cindex @code{list} directive
@cindex listing control, turning on
Control (in conjunction with the @code{.nolist} directive) whether or
not assembly listings are generated.  These two directives maintain an
internal counter (which is zero initially).   @code{.list} increments the
counter, and @code{.nolist} decrements it.  Assembly listings are
generated whenever the counter is greater than zero.

By default, listings are disabled.  When you enable them (with the
@samp{-a} command line option; @pxref{Invoking,,Command-Line Options}),
the initial value of the listing counter is one.

@node Ln
@section @code{.ln @var{line-number}}

@cindex @code{ln} directive
@ifclear no-line-dir
@samp{.ln} is a synonym for @samp{.line}.
@end ifclear
@ifset no-line-dir
Tell @command{@value{AS}} to change the logical line number.  @var{line-number}
must be an absolute expression.  The next line has that logical
line number, so any other statements on the current line (after a
statement separator character @code{;}) are reported as on logical
line number @var{line-number} @minus{} 1.
@ifset BOUT

This directive is accepted, but ignored, when @command{@value{AS}} is
configured for @code{b.out}; its effect is only associated with COFF
output format.
@end ifset
@end ifset

@node Loc
@section @code{.loc @var{fileno} @var{lineno} [@var{column}] [@var{options}]}
@cindex @code{loc} directive
When emitting DWARF2 line number information,
the @code{.loc} directive will add a row to the @code{.debug_line} line
number matrix corresponding to the immediately following assembly
instruction.  The @var{fileno}, @var{lineno}, and optional @var{column}
arguments will be applied to the @code{.debug_line} state machine before
the row is added.

The @var{options} are a sequence of the following tokens in any order:

@table @code
@item basic_block
This option will set the @code{basic_block} register in the
@code{.debug_line} state machine to @code{true}.

@item prologue_end
This option will set the @code{prologue_end} register in the
@code{.debug_line} state machine to @code{true}.

@item epilogue_begin
This option will set the @code{epilogue_begin} register in the
@code{.debug_line} state machine to @code{true}.

@item is_stmt @var{value}
This option will set the @code{is_stmt} register in the
@code{.debug_line} state machine to @code{value}, which must be
either 0 or 1.

@item isa @var{value}
This directive will set the @code{isa} register in the @code{.debug_line}
state machine to @var{value}, which must be an unsigned integer.

@item discriminator @var{value}
This directive will set the @code{discriminator} register in the @code{.debug_line}
state machine to @var{value}, which must be an unsigned integer.

@end table

@node Loc_mark_labels
@section @code{.loc_mark_labels @var{enable}}
@cindex @code{loc_mark_labels} directive
When emitting DWARF2 line number information,
the @code{.loc_mark_labels} directive makes the assembler emit an entry
to the @code{.debug_line} line number matrix with the @code{basic_block}
register in the state machine set whenever a code label is seen.
The @var{enable} argument should be either 1 or 0, to enable or disable
this function respectively.

@ifset ELF
@node Local
@section @code{.local @var{names}}

@cindex @code{local} directive
This directive, which is available for ELF targets, marks each symbol in
the comma-separated list of @code{names} as a local symbol so that it
will not be externally visible.  If the symbols do not already exist,
they will be created.

For targets where the @code{.lcomm} directive (@pxref{Lcomm}) does not
accept an alignment argument, which is the case for most ELF targets,
the @code{.local} directive can be used in combination with @code{.comm}
(@pxref{Comm}) to define aligned local common data.
@end ifset

@node Long
@section @code{.long @var{expressions}}

@cindex @code{long} directive
@code{.long} is the same as @samp{.int}.  @xref{Int,,@code{.int}}.

@node Lsym
@section @code{.lsym @var{symbol}, @var{expression}}

@cindex @code{lsym} directive
@cindex symbol, not referenced in assembly
@code{.lsym} creates a new symbol named @var{symbol}, but does not put it in
the hash table, ensuring it cannot be referenced by name during the
rest of the assembly.  This sets the attributes of the symbol to be
the same as the expression value:
@example
@var{other} = @var{descriptor} = 0
@var{type} = @r{(section of @var{expression})}
@var{value} = @var{expression}
@end example
@noindent
The new symbol is not flagged as external.
@end ignore

@node Macro
@section @code{.macro}

@cindex macros
The commands @code{.macro} and @code{.endm} allow you to define macros that
generate assembly output.  For example, this definition specifies a macro
@code{sum} that puts a sequence of numbers into memory:

@example
        .macro  sum from=0, to=5
        .long   \from
        .if     \to-\from
        sum     "(\from+1)",\to
        .endif
        .endm
@end example

@noindent
With that definition, @samp{SUM 0,5} is equivalent to this assembly input:

@example
        .long   0
        .long   1
        .long   2
        .long   3
        .long   4
        .long   5
@end example

@ftable @code
@item .macro @var{macname}
@itemx .macro @var{macname} @var{macargs} @dots{}
@cindex @code{macro} directive
Begin the definition of a macro called @var{macname}.  If your macro
definition requires arguments, specify their names after the macro name,
separated by commas or spaces.  You can qualify the macro argument to
indicate whether all invocations must specify a non-blank value (through
@samp{:@code{req}}), or whether it takes all of the remaining arguments
(through @samp{:@code{vararg}}).  You can supply a default value for any
macro argument by following the name with @samp{=@var{deflt}}.  You
cannot define two macros with the same @var{macname} unless it has been
subject to the @code{.purgem} directive (@pxref{Purgem}) between the two
definitions.  For example, these are all valid @code{.macro} statements:

@table @code
@item .macro comm
Begin the definition of a macro called @code{comm}, which takes no
arguments.

@item  .macro plus1 p, p1
@itemx .macro plus1 p p1
Either statement begins the definition of a macro called @code{plus1},
which takes two arguments; within the macro definition, write
@samp{\p} or @samp{\p1} to evaluate the arguments.

@item .macro reserve_str p1=0 p2
Begin the definition of a macro called @code{reserve_str}, with two
arguments.  The first argument has a default value, but not the second.
After the definition is complete, you can call the macro either as
@samp{reserve_str @var{a},@var{b}} (with @samp{\p1} evaluating to
@var{a} and @samp{\p2} evaluating to @var{b}), or as @samp{reserve_str
,@var{b}} (with @samp{\p1} evaluating as the default, in this case
@samp{0}, and @samp{\p2} evaluating to @var{b}).

@item .macro m p1:req, p2=0, p3:vararg
Begin the definition of a macro called @code{m}, with at least three
arguments.  The first argument must always have a value specified, but
not the second, which instead has a default value. The third formal
will get assigned all remaining arguments specified at invocation time.

When you call a macro, you can specify the argument values either by
position, or by keyword.  For example, @samp{sum 9,17} is equivalent to
@samp{sum to=17, from=9}.

@end table

Note that since each of the @var{macargs} can be an identifier exactly
as any other one permitted by the target architecture, there may be
occasional problems if the target hand-crafts special meanings to certain
characters when they occur in a special position.  For example, if the colon
(@code{:}) is generally permitted to be part of a symbol name, but the
architecture specific code special-cases it when occurring as the final
character of a symbol (to denote a label), then the macro parameter
replacement code will have no way of knowing that and consider the whole
construct (including the colon) an identifier, and check only this
identifier for being the subject to parameter substitution.  So for example
this macro definition:

@example
	.macro label l
\l:
	.endm
@end example

might not work as expected.  Invoking @samp{label foo} might not create a label
called @samp{foo} but instead just insert the text @samp{\l:} into the
assembler source, probably generating an error about an unrecognised
identifier.

Similarly problems might occur with the period character (@samp{.})
which is often allowed inside opcode names (and hence identifier names).  So
for example constructing a macro to build an opcode from a base name and a
length specifier like this:

@example
	.macro opcode base length
        \base.\length
	.endm
@end example

and invoking it as @samp{opcode store l} will not create a @samp{store.l}
instruction but instead generate some kind of error as the assembler tries to
interpret the text @samp{\base.\length}.

There are several possible ways around this problem:

@table @code
@item Insert white space
If it is possible to use white space characters then this is the simplest
solution.  eg:

@example
	.macro label l
\l :
	.endm
@end example

@item Use @samp{\()}
The string @samp{\()} can be used to separate the end of a macro argument from
the following text.  eg:

@example
	.macro opcode base length
        \base\().\length
	.endm
@end example

@item Use the alternate macro syntax mode
In the alternative macro syntax mode the ampersand character (@samp{&}) can be
used as a separator.  eg:

@example
	.altmacro
	.macro label l
l&:
	.endm
@end example
@end table

Note: this problem of correctly identifying string parameters to pseudo ops
also applies to the identifiers used in @code{.irp} (@pxref{Irp})
and @code{.irpc} (@pxref{Irpc}) as well.

@item .endm
@cindex @code{endm} directive
Mark the end of a macro definition.

@item .exitm
@cindex @code{exitm} directive
Exit early from the current macro definition.

@cindex number of macros executed

@node MRI
@section @code{.mri @var{val}}

@cindex @code{mri} directive
@cindex MRI mode, temporarily
If @var{val} is non-zero, this tells @command{@value{AS}} to enter MRI mode.  If
@var{val} is zero, this tells @command{@value{AS}} to exit MRI mode.  This change
affects code assembled until the next @code{.mri} directive, or until the end
of the file.  @xref{M, MRI mode, MRI mode}.

@node Noaltmacro
@section @code{.noaltmacro}

@node Nolist
@section @code{.nolist}

@cindex @code{nolist} directive
@cindex listing control, turning off
Control (in conjunction with the @code{.list} directive) whether or
not assembly listings are generated.  These two directives maintain an
internal counter (which is zero initially).   @code{.list} increments the
counter, and @code{.nolist} decrements it.  Assembly listings are
generated whenever the counter is greater than zero.

@node Octa
@section @code{.octa @var{bignums}}

@c FIXME: double size emitted for "octa" on i960, others?  Or warn?
@cindex @code{octa} directive
@cindex integer, 16-byte
@cindex sixteen byte integer
This directive expects zero or more bignums, separated by commas.  For each
bignum, it emits a 16-byte integer.

The term ``octa'' comes from contexts in which a ``word'' is two bytes;
hence @emph{octa}-word for 16 bytes.

@node Offset
@section @code{.offset @var{loc}}

@cindex @code{offset} directive
Set the location counter to @var{loc} in the absolute section.  @var{loc} must
be an absolute expression.  This directive may be useful for defining
symbols with absolute values.  Do not confuse it with the @code{.org}
directive.

@node Org
@section @code{.org @var{new-lc} , @var{fill}}

@cindex @code{org} directive
@cindex location counter, advancing
@cindex advancing location counter
@cindex current address, advancing
Advance the location counter of the current section to
@var{new-lc}.  @var{new-lc} is either an absolute expression or an
expression with the same section as the current subsection.  That is,
you can't use @code{.org} to cross sections: if @var{new-lc} has the
wrong section, the @code{.org} directive is ignored.  To be compatible
with former assemblers, if the section of @var{new-lc} is absolute,
@command{@value{AS}} issues a warning, then pretends the section of @var{new-lc}
is the same as the current subsection.

@code{.org} may only increase the location counter, or leave it
unchanged; you cannot use @code{.org} to move the location counter
backwards.

@c double negative used below "not undefined" because this is a specific
@c reference to "undefined" (as SEG_UNKNOWN is called in this manual)
@c section. doc@cygnus.com 18feb91
Because @command{@value{AS}} tries to assemble programs in one pass, @var{new-lc}
may not be undefined.  If you really detest this restriction we eagerly await
a chance to share your improved assembler.

Beware that the origin is relative to the start of the section, not
to the start of the subsection.  This is compatible with other
people's assemblers.

When the location counter (of the current subsection) is advanced, the
intervening bytes are filled with @var{fill} which should be an
absolute expression.  If the comma and @var{fill} are omitted,
@var{fill} defaults to zero.

@node P2align
@section @code{.p2align[wl] @var{abs-expr}, @var{abs-expr}, @var{abs-expr}}

@cindex padding the location counter given a power of two
@cindex @code{p2align} directive
Pad the location counter (in the current subsection) to a particular
storage boundary.  The first expression (which must be absolute) is the
number of low-order zero bits the location counter must have after
advancement.  For example @samp{.p2align 3} advances the location
counter until it a multiple of 8.  If the location counter is already a
multiple of 8, no change is needed.

The second expression (also absolute) gives the fill value to be stored in the
padding bytes.  It (and the comma) may be omitted.  If it is omitted, the
padding bytes are normally zero.  However, on some systems, if the section is
marked as containing code and the fill value is omitted, the space is filled
with no-op instructions.

The third expression is also absolute, and is also optional.  If it is present,
it is the maximum number of bytes that should be skipped by this alignment
directive.  If doing the alignment would require skipping more bytes than the
specified maximum, then the alignment is not done at all.  You can omit the
fill value (the second argument) entirely by simply using two commas after the
required alignment; this can be useful if you want the alignment to be filled
with no-op instructions when appropriate.

@cindex @code{p2alignw} directive
@cindex @code{p2alignl} directive
The @code{.p2alignw} and @code{.p2alignl} directives are variants of the
@code{.p2align} directive.  The @code{.p2alignw} directive treats the fill
pattern as a two byte word value.  The @code{.p2alignl} directives treats the
fill pattern as a four byte longword value.  For example, @code{.p2alignw
2,0x368d} will align to a multiple of 4.  If it skips two bytes, they will be
filled in with the value 0x368d (the exact placement of the bytes depends upon
the endianness of the processor).  If it skips 1 or 3 bytes, the fill value is
undefined.

(@pxref{PopSection}).

This directive swaps the current section (and subsection) with most recently
referenced section/subsection pair prior to this one.  Multiple
@code{.previous} directives in a row will flip between two sections (and their
subsections).  For example:

@example
.section A
 .subsection 1
  .word 0x1234
 .subsection 2
  .word 0x5678
.previous
 .word 0x9abc
@end example

Will place 0x1234 and 0x9abc into subsection 1 and 0x5678 into subsection 2 of
section A.  Whilst:

@example
.section A
.subsection 1
  # Now in section A subsection 1
  .word 0x1234
.section B
.subsection 0
  # Now in section B subsection 0
  .word 0x5678
.subsection 1
  # Now in section B subsection 1
  .word 0x9abc
.previous
  # Now in section B subsection 0
  .word 0xdef0
@end example

Will place 0x1234 into section A, 0x5678 and 0xdef0 into subsection 0 of
section B and 0x9abc into subsection 1 of section B.

In terms of the section stack, this directive swaps the current section with
the top section on the section stack.
@end ifset

@node Print
@section @code{.print @var{string}}

@cindex @code{print} directive
@command{@value{AS}} will print @var{string} on the standard output during
assembly.  You must put @var{string} in double quotes.

@ifset ELF
@node Protected
@section @code{.protected @var{names}}

@cindex @code{protected} directive
@cindex visibility
This is one of the ELF visibility directives.  The other two are
@code{.hidden} (@pxref{Hidden}) and @code{.internal} (@pxref{Internal}).

This directive overrides the named symbols default visibility (which is set by
their binding: local, global or weak).  The directive sets the visibility to
@code{protected} which means that any references to the symbols from within the
components that defines them must be resolved to the definition in that
component, even if a definition in another component would normally preempt
this.
@end ifset

@node Psize
@section @code{.psize @var{lines} , @var{columns}}

@cindex @code{psize} directive
@cindex listing control: paper size
@cindex paper size, for listings
Use this directive to declare the number of lines---and, optionally, the
number of columns---to use for each page, when generating listings.

If you do not use @code{.psize}, listings use a default line-count
of 60.  You may omit the comma and @var{columns} specification; the
default width is 200 columns.

@command{@value{AS}} generates formfeeds whenever the specified number of
lines is exceeded (or whenever you explicitly request one, using
@code{.eject}).

If you specify @var{lines} as @code{0}, no formfeeds are generated save
those explicitly specified with @code{.eject}.

@node Purgem
@section @code{.purgem @var{name}}

@cindex @code{purgem} directive
Undefine the macro @var{name}, so that later uses of the string will not be
expanded.  @xref{Macro}.

@ifset ELF
@node PushSection
@section @code{.pushsection @var{name} [, @var{subsection}] [, "@var{flags}"[, @@@var{type}[,@var{arguments}]]]}

@cindex @code{pushsection} directive
@cindex Section Stack
This is one of the ELF section stack manipulation directives.  The others are
@code{.section} (@pxref{Section}), @code{.subsection} (@pxref{SubSection}),
@code{.popsection} (@pxref{PopSection}), and @code{.previous}
(@pxref{Previous}).

This directive pushes the current section (and subsection) onto the
top of the section stack, and then replaces the current section and
subsection with @code{name} and @code{subsection}. The optional
@code{flags}, @code{type} and @code{arguments} are treated the same
as in the @code{.section} (@pxref{Section}) directive.
@end ifset

@node Quad
@section @code{.quad @var{bignums}}

@cindex @code{quad} directive
@code{.quad} expects zero or more bignums, separated by commas.  For
each bignum, it emits
@ifclear bignum-16
an 8-byte integer.  If the bignum won't fit in 8 bytes, it prints a
warning message; and just takes the lowest order 8 bytes of the bignum.
@cindex eight-byte integer
@cindex integer, 8-byte

The term ``quad'' comes from contexts in which a ``word'' is two bytes;
hence @emph{quad}-word for 8 bytes.
@end ifclear
@ifset bignum-16
a 16-byte integer.  If the bignum won't fit in 16 bytes, it prints a
warning message; and just takes the lowest order 16 bytes of the bignum.
@cindex sixteen-byte integer
@cindex integer, 16-byte
@end ifset

@node Reloc
@section @code{.reloc @var{offset}, @var{reloc_name}[, @var{expression}]}

@cindex @code{reloc} directive
Generate a relocation at @var{offset} of type @var{reloc_name} with value
@var{expression}.  If @var{offset} is a number, the relocation is generated in
the current section.  If @var{offset} is an expression that resolves to a
symbol plus offset, the relocation is generated in the given symbol's section.
@var{expression}, if present, must resolve to a symbol plus addend or to an
absolute value, but note that not all targets support an addend.  e.g. ELF REL
targets such as i386 store an addend in the section contents rather than in the
relocation.  This low level interface does not support addends stored in the
section.

@node Rept
@section @code{.rept @var{count}}

@cindex @code{rept} directive
Repeat the sequence of lines between the @code{.rept} directive and the next
@code{.endr} directive @var{count} times.

For example, assembling

@example
        .rept   3
        .long   0
        .endr
@end example

is equivalent to assembling

@example
        .long   0
        .long   0
        .long   0
@end example

@node Sbttl
@section @code{.sbttl "@var{subheading}"}

@cindex @code{sbttl} directive
@cindex subtitles for listings
@cindex listing control: subtitle
Use @var{subheading} as the title (third line, immediately after the
title line) when generating assembly listings.

This directive affects subsequent pages, as well as the current page if
it appears within ten lines of the top of a page.

@ifset COFF
@node Scl
@section @code{.scl @var{class}}

@cindex @code{scl} directive
@cindex symbol storage class (COFF)
@cindex COFF symbol storage class
Set the storage-class value for a symbol.  This directive may only be
used inside a @code{.def}/@code{.endef} pair.  Storage class may flag
whether a symbol is static or external, or it may record further
symbolic debugging information.
@ifset BOUT

The @samp{.scl} directive is primarily associated with COFF output; when
configured to generate @code{b.out} output format, @command{@value{AS}}
accepts this directive but ignores it.
@end ifset
@end ifset

@node Section
@section @code{.section @var{name}}

@cindex named section
Use the @code{.section} directive to assemble the following code into a section
named @var{name}.

This directive is only supported for targets that actually support arbitrarily
named sections; on @code{a.out} targets, for example, it is not accepted, even
with a standard @code{a.out} section name.

@cindex Section Stack
This is one of the ELF section stack manipulation directives.  The others are
@code{.subsection} (@pxref{SubSection}), @code{.pushsection}
(@pxref{PushSection}), @code{.popsection} (@pxref{PopSection}), and
@code{.previous} (@pxref{Previous}).

@cindex @code{section} directive (ELF version)
For ELF targets, the @code{.section} directive is used like this:

@example
.section @var{name} [, "@var{flags}"[, @@@var{type}[,@var{flag_specific_arguments}]]]
@end example

The optional @var{flags} argument is a quoted string which may contain any
combination of the following characters:
@table @code
@item a
section is allocatable
@item e
section is excluded from executable and shared library.
@item w
section is writable
@item x
section is executable
@item M
section is mergeable
@item S
section contains zero terminated strings
@item G
section is a member of a section group
@item T
section is used for thread-local-storage
@item ?
section is a member of the previously-current section's group, if any
@end table

The optional @var{type} argument may contain one of the following constants:
@table @code
@item @@progbits
section contains data
@item @@nobits
section does not contain data (i.e., section only occupies space)
@item @@note
section contains data which is used by things other than the program
@item @@init_array
section contains an array of pointers to init functions
@item @@fini_array
section contains an array of pointers to finish functions
@item @@preinit_array
section contains an array of pointers to pre-init functions
@end table

Many targets only support the first three section types.

Note on targets where the @code{@@} character is the start of a comment (eg
ARM) then another character is used instead.  For example the ARM port uses the
@code{%} character.

If @var{flags} contains the @code{M} symbol then the @var{type} argument must
be specified as well as an extra argument---@var{entsize}---like this:

@example
.section @var{name} , "@var{flags}"M, @@@var{type}, @var{entsize}
@end example

Sections with the @code{M} flag but not @code{S} flag must contain fixed size
constants, each @var{entsize} octets long. Sections with both @code{M} and
@code{S} must contain zero terminated strings where each character is
@var{entsize} bytes long. The linker may remove duplicates within sections with
the same name, same entity size and same flags.  @var{entsize} must be an
absolute expression.  For sections with both @code{M} and @code{S}, a string
which is a suffix of a larger string is considered a duplicate.  Thus
@code{"def"} will be merged with @code{"abcdef"};  A reference to the first
@code{"def"} will be changed to a reference to @code{"abcdef"+3}.

If @var{flags} contains the @code{G} symbol then the @var{type} argument must
be present along with an additional field like this:

@example
.section @var{name} , "@var{flags}"G, @@@var{type}, @var{GroupName}[, @var{linkage}]
@end example

The @var{GroupName} field specifies the name of the section group to which this
particular section belongs.  The optional linkage field can contain:
@table @code
@item comdat
indicates that only one copy of this section should be retained
@item .gnu.linkonce
an alias for comdat
@end table

Note: if both the @var{M} and @var{G} flags are present then the fields for
the Merge flag should come first, like this:

@example
.section @var{name} , "@var{flags}"MG, @@@var{type}, @var{entsize}, @var{GroupName}[, @var{linkage}]
@end example

If @var{flags} contains the @code{?} symbol then it may not also contain the
@code{G} symbol and the @var{GroupName} or @var{linkage} fields should not be
present.  Instead, @code{?} says to consider the section that's current before
this directive.  If that section used @code{G}, then the new section will use
@code{G} with those same @var{GroupName} and @var{linkage} fields implicitly.
If not, then the @code{?} symbol has no effect.

If no flags are specified, the default flags depend upon the section name.  If
the section name is not recognized, the default will be for the section to have
none of the above flags: it will not be allocated in memory, nor writable, nor
executable.  The section will contain data.

For ELF targets, the assembler supports another type of @code{.section}
directive for compatibility with the Solaris assembler:

@example
.section "@var{name}"[, @var{flags}...]
@end example

Note that the section name is quoted.  There may be a sequence of comma
separated flags:
@table @code
@item #alloc
section is allocatable
@item #write
section is writable
@item #execinstr
section is executable
@item #exclude
section is excluded from executable and shared library.
@item #tls
section is used for thread local storage
@end table

This directive replaces the current section and subsection.  See the
contents of the gas testsuite directory @code{gas/testsuite/gas/elf} for
some examples of how this directive and the other section stack directives
work.

@node Set
@section @code{.set @var{symbol}, @var{expression}}

@cindex @code{set} directive
@cindex symbol value, setting
Set the value of @var{symbol} to @var{expression}.  This
changes @var{symbol}'s value and type to conform to
@var{expression}.  If @var{symbol} was flagged as external, it remains
flagged (@pxref{Symbol Attributes}).

You may @code{.set} a symbol many times in the same assembly.

If you @code{.set} a global symbol, the value stored in the object
file is the last value stored into it.

@ifset Z80
On Z80 @code{set} is a real instruction, use
@samp{@var{symbol} defl @var{expression}} instead.
@end ifset

@node Short
@section @code{.short @var{expressions}}

@cindex @code{short} directive
@code{.short} is normally the same as @samp{.word}.
@xref{Word,,@code{.word}}.

In some configurations, however, @code{.short} and @code{.word} generate
numbers of different lengths.  @xref{Machine Dependencies}.

@node Single
@section @code{.single @var{flonums}}

@cindex @code{single} directive
@cindex floating point numbers (single)
This directive assembles zero or more flonums, separated by commas.  It
has the same effect as @code{.float}.
The exact kind of floating point numbers emitted depends on how
@command{@value{AS}} is configured.  @xref{Machine Dependencies}.

@node Size
@section @code{.size}

This directive is used to set the size associated with a symbol.

@cindex @code{size} directive (ELF version)
For ELF targets, the @code{.size} directive is used like this:

@example
.size @var{name} , @var{expression}
@end example

This directive sets the size associated with a symbol @var{name}.
The size in bytes is computed from @var{expression} which can make use of label
arithmetic.  This directive is typically used to set the size of function
symbols.

@ifclear no-space-dir
@node Skip
@section @code{.skip @var{size} , @var{fill}}

@cindex @code{skip} directive
@cindex filling memory
This directive emits @var{size} bytes, each of value @var{fill}.  Both
@var{size} and @var{fill} are absolute expressions.  If the comma and
@var{fill} are omitted, @var{fill} is assumed to be zero.  This is the same as
@samp{.space}.
@end ifclear

@node Sleb128
@section @code{.sleb128 @var{expressions}}

@cindex @code{sleb128} directive
@var{sleb128} stands for ``signed little endian base 128.''  This is a
compact, variable length representation of numbers used by the DWARF
symbolic debugging format.  @xref{Uleb128, ,@code{.uleb128}}.

@ifclear no-space-dir
@node Space
@section @code{.space @var{size} , @var{fill}}

@cindex @code{space} directive
@cindex filling memory
This directive emits @var{size} bytes, each of value @var{fill}.  Both
@var{size} and @var{fill} are absolute expressions.  If the comma
and @var{fill} are omitted, @var{fill} is assumed to be zero.  This is the same
as @samp{.skip}.

@ifset HPPA
@quotation
@emph{Warning:} @code{.space} has a completely different meaning for HPPA
targets; use @code{.block} as a substitute.  See @cite{HP9000 Series 800
Assembly Language Reference Manual} (HP 92432-90001) for the meaning of the
@code{.space} directive.  @xref{HPPA Directives,,HPPA Assembler Directives},
for a summary.
@end quotation
@end ifset
@end ifclear

@node String
@section @code{.string} "@var{str}", @code{.string8} "@var{str}", @code{.string16}
"@var{str}", @code{.string32} "@var{str}", @code{.string64} "@var{str}"

@cindex string, copying to object file
@cindex string8, copying to object file
@cindex string16, copying to object file
@cindex string32, copying to object file
@cindex string64, copying to object file
@cindex @code{string} directive
@cindex @code{string8} directive
@cindex @code{string16} directive
@cindex @code{string32} directive
@cindex @code{string64} directive

Copy the characters in @var{str} to the object file.  You may specify more than
one string to copy, separated by commas.  Unless otherwise specified for a
particular machine, the assembler marks the end of each string with a 0 byte.
You can use any of the escape sequences described in @ref{Strings,,Strings}.

The variants @code{string16}, @code{string32} and @code{string64} differ from
the @code{string} pseudo opcode in that each 8-bit character from @var{str} is
copied and expanded to 16, 32 or 64 bits respectively.  The expanded characters
are stored in target endianness byte order.

Example:
@example
	.string32 "BYE"
expands to:
	.string   "B\0\0\0Y\0\0\0E\0\0\0"  /* On little endian targets.  */
	.string   "\0\0\0B\0\0\0Y\0\0\0E"  /* On big endian targets.  */
@end example


@node Struct
@section @code{.struct @var{expression}}

@cindex @code{struct} directive
Switch to the absolute section, and set the section offset to @var{expression},
which must be an absolute expression.  You might use this as follows:
@example
        .struct 0
field1:
        .struct field1 + 4
field2:
        .struct field2 + 4
field3:
@end example
This would define the symbol @code{field1} to have the value 0, the symbol
@code{field2} to have the value 4, and the symbol @code{field3} to have the
value 8.  Assembly would be left in the absolute section, and you would need to
use a @code{.section} directive of some sort to change to some other section
before further assembly.

@ifset ELF
@node SubSection
@section @code{.subsection @var{name}}

@cindex @code{subsection} directive
@cindex Section Stack
This is one of the ELF section stack manipulation directives.  The others are
@code{.section} (@pxref{Section}), @code{.pushsection} (@pxref{PushSection}),
@code{.popsection} (@pxref{PopSection}), and @code{.previous}
(@pxref{Previous}).

This directive replaces the current subsection with @code{name}.  The current
section is not changed.  The replaced subsection is put onto the section stack
in place of the then current top of stack subsection.
@end ifset

@ifset ELF
@node Symver
@section @code{.symver}
@cindex @code{symver} directive
@cindex symbol versioning
@cindex versions of symbols
Use the @code{.symver} directive to bind symbols to specific version nodes
within a source file.  This is only supported on ELF platforms, and is
typically used when assembling files to be linked into a shared library.
There are cases where it may make sense to use this in objects to be bound
into an application itself so as to override a versioned symbol from a
shared library.

For ELF targets, the @code{.symver} directive can be used like this:
@example
.symver @var{name}, @var{name2@@nodename}
@end example
If the symbol @var{name} is defined within the file
being assembled, the @code{.symver} directive effectively creates a symbol
alias with the name @var{name2@@nodename}, and in fact the main reason that we
just don't try and create a regular alias is that the @var{@@} character isn't
permitted in symbol names.  The @var{name2} part of the name is the actual name
of the symbol by which it will be externally referenced.  The name @var{name}
itself is merely a name of convenience that is used so that it is possible to
have definitions for multiple versions of a function within a single source
file, and so that the compiler can unambiguously know which version of a
function is being mentioned.  The @var{nodename} portion of the alias should be
the name of a node specified in the version script supplied to the linker when
building a shared library.  If you are attempting to override a versioned
symbol from a shared library, then @var{nodename} should correspond to the
nodename of the symbol you are trying to override.

If the symbol @var{name} is not defined within the file being assembled, all
references to @var{name} will be changed to @var{name2@@nodename}.  If no
reference to @var{name} is made, @var{name2@@nodename} will be removed from the
symbol table.

Another usage of the @code{.symver} directive is:
@example
.symver @var{name}, @var{name2@@@@nodename}
@end example
In this case, the symbol @var{name} must exist and be defined within
the file being assembled. It is similar to @var{name2@@nodename}. The
difference is @var{name2@@@@nodename} will also be used to resolve
references to @var{name2} by the linker.

The third usage of the @code{.symver} directive is:
@example
.symver @var{name}, @var{name2@@@@@@nodename}
@end example
When @var{name} is not defined within the
file being assembled, it is treated as @var{name2@@nodename}. When
@var{name} is defined within the file being assembled, the symbol
name, @var{name}, will be changed to @var{name2@@@@nodename}.
@end ifset

@node Text
@section @code{.text @var{subsection}}

@cindex @code{text} directive
Tells @command{@value{AS}} to assemble the following statements onto the end of
the text subsection numbered @var{subsection}, which is an absolute
expression.  If @var{subsection} is omitted, subsection number zero
is used.

@node Title
@section @code{.title "@var{heading}"}

@cindex @code{title} directive
@cindex listing control: title line
Use @var{heading} as the title (second line, immediately after the
source file name and pagenumber) when generating assembly listings.

This directive affects subsequent pages, as well as the current page if
it appears within ten lines of the top of a page.

@node Type
@section @code{.type}

This directive is used to set the type of a symbol.

@cindex ELF symbol type
@cindex symbol type, ELF
@cindex @code{type} directive (ELF version)
For ELF targets, the @code{.type} directive is used like this:

@example
.type @var{name} , @var{type description}
@end example

This sets the type of symbol @var{name} to be either a
function symbol or an object symbol.  There are five different syntaxes
supported for the @var{type description} field, in order to provide
compatibility with various other assemblers.

Because some of the characters used in these syntaxes (such as @samp{@@} and
@samp{#}) are comment characters for some architectures, some of the syntaxes
below do not work on all architectures.  The first variant will be accepted by
the GNU assembler on all architectures so that variant should be used for
maximum portability, if you do not need to assemble your code with other
assemblers.

The syntaxes supported are:

@example
  .type <name> STT_<TYPE_IN_UPPER_CASE>
  .type <name>,#<type>
  .type <name>,@@<type>
  .type <name>,%<type>
  .type <name>,"<type>"
@end example

The types supported are:

@table @code
@item STT_FUNC
@itemx function
Mark the symbol as being a function name.

@item STT_GNU_IFUNC
@itemx gnu_indirect_function
Mark the symbol as an indirect function when evaluated during reloc
processing.  (This is only supported on assemblers targeting GNU systems).

@item STT_OBJECT
@itemx object
Mark the symbol as being a data object.

@item STT_TLS
@itemx tls_object
Mark the symbol as being a thead-local data object.

@item STT_COMMON
@itemx common
Mark the symbol as being a common data object.

@item STT_NOTYPE
@itemx notype
Does not mark the symbol in any way.  It is supported just for completeness.

@item gnu_unique_object
Marks the symbol as being a globally unique data object.  The dynamic linker
will make sure that in the entire process there is just one symbol with this
name and type in use.  (This is only supported on assemblers targeting GNU
systems).

@end table

Note: Some targets support extra types in addition to those listed above.

@node Uleb128
@section @code{.uleb128 @var{expressions}}

@cindex @code{uleb128} directive
@var{uleb128} stands for ``unsigned little endian base 128.''  This is a
compact, variable length representation of numbers used by the DWARF
symbolic debugging format.  @xref{Sleb128, ,@code{.sleb128}}.

@ifset COFF
@node Val
@section @code{.val @var{addr}}

@cindex @code{val} directive
@cindex COFF value attribute
@cindex value attribute, COFF
This directive, permitted only within @code{.def}/@code{.endef} pairs,
records the address @var{addr} as the value attribute of a symbol table
entry.
@ifset BOUT

@samp{.val} is used only for COFF output; when @command{@value{AS}} is
configured for @code{b.out}, it accepts this directive but ignores it.
@end ifset
@end ifset

@ifset ELF
@node Version
@section @code{.version "@var{string}"}

@cindex @code{version} directive
This directive creates a @code{.note} section and places into it an ELF
formatted note of type NT_VERSION.  The note's name is set to @code{string}.
@end ifset

@ifset ELF
@node VTableEntry
@section @code{.vtable_entry @var{table}, @var{offset}}

@cindex @code{vtable_entry} directive
This directive finds or creates a symbol @code{table} and creates a
@code{VTABLE_ENTRY} relocation for it with an addend of @code{offset}.

@node VTableInherit
@section @code{.vtable_inherit @var{child}, @var{parent}}

@cindex @code{vtable_inherit} directive
This directive finds the symbol @code{child} and finds or creates the symbol
@code{parent} and then creates a @code{VTABLE_INHERIT} relocation for the
parent whose addend is the value of the child symbol.  As a special case the
parent name of @code{0} is treated as referring to the @code{*ABS*} section.
@end ifset

@node Warning
@section @code{.warning "@var{string}"}
@cindex warning directive
Similar to the directive @code{.error}
(@pxref{Error,,@code{.error "@var{string}"}}), but just emits a warning.

@node Weak
@section @code{.weak @var{names}}

@cindex @code{weak} directive
This directive sets the weak attribute on the comma separated list of symbol
@code{names}.  If the symbols do not already exist, they will be created.

On COFF targets other than PE, weak symbols are a GNU extension.  This
directive sets the weak attribute on the comma separated list of symbol
@code{names}.  If the symbols do not already exist, they will be created.

On the PE target, weak symbols are supported natively as weak aliases.
When a weak symbol is created that is not an alias, GAS creates an
alternate symbol to hold the default value.

@node Weakref
@section @code{.weakref @var{alias}, @var{target}}

@cindex @code{weakref} directive
This directive creates an alias to the target symbol that enables the symbol to
be referenced with weak-symbol semantics, but without actually making it weak.
If direct references or definitions of the symbol are present, then the symbol
will not be weak, but if all references to it are through weak references, the
symbol will be marked as weak in the symbol table.

The effect is equivalent to moving all references to the alias to a separate
assembly source file, renaming the alias to the symbol in it, declaring the
symbol as weak there, and running a reloadable link to merge the object files

@emph{Warning: Special Treatment to support Compilers}
@end quotation

Machines with a 32-bit address space, but that do less than 32-bit
addressing, require the following special treatment.  If the machine of
interest to you does 32-bit addressing (or doesn't require it;
@pxref{Machine Dependencies}), you can ignore this issue.

In order to assemble compiler output into something that works,
@command{@value{AS}} occasionally does strange things to @samp{.word} directives.
Directives of the form @samp{.word sym1-sym2} are often emitted by
compilers as part of jump tables.  Therefore, when @command{@value{AS}} assembles a
directive of the form @samp{.word sym1-sym2}, and the difference between
@code{sym1} and @code{sym2} does not fit in 16 bits, @command{@value{AS}}
creates a @dfn{secondary jump table}, immediately before the next label.
This secondary jump table is preceded by a short-jump to the
first byte after the secondary table.  This short-jump prevents the flow
of control from accidentally falling into the new table.  Inside the
table is a long-jump to @code{sym2}.  The original @samp{.word}
contains @code{sym1} minus the address of the long-jump to
@code{sym2}.

If there were several occurrences of @samp{.word sym1-sym2} before the
secondary jump table, all of them are adjusted.  If there was a
@samp{.word sym3-sym4}, that also did not fit in sixteen bits, a
long-jump to @code{sym4} is included in the secondary jump table,
and the @code{.word} directives are adjusted to contain @code{sym3}
minus the address of the long-jump to @code{sym4}; and so on, for as many
entries in the original jump table as necessary.

@node Object Attributes
@chapter Object Attributes
@cindex object attributes

@command{@value{AS}} assembles source files written for a specific architecture
into object files for that architecture.  But not all object files are alike.
Many architectures support incompatible variations.  For instance, floating
point arguments might be passed in floating point registers if the object file
requires hardware floating point support---or floating point arguments might be
passed in integer registers if the object file supports processors with no
hardware floating point unit.  Or, if two objects are built for different
generations of the same architecture, the combination may require the
newer generation at run-time.

This information is useful during and after linking.  At link time,
@command{@value{LD}} can warn about incompatible object files.  After link
time, tools like @command{gdb} can use it to process the linked file
correctly.

Compatibility information is recorded as a series of object attributes.  Each
attribute has a @dfn{vendor}, @dfn{tag}, and @dfn{value}.  The vendor is a
string, and indicates who sets the meaning of the tag.  The tag is an integer,
and indicates what property the attribute describes.  The value may be a string
or an integer, and indicates how the property affects this object.  Missing
attributes are the same as attributes with a zero value or empty string value.

Object attributes were developed as part of the ABI for the ARM Architecture.
The file format is documented in @cite{ELF for the ARM Architecture}.

@node GNU Object Attributes
@section @sc{gnu} Object Attributes

The @code{.gnu_attribute} directive records an object attribute
with vendor @samp{gnu}.

Except for @samp{Tag_compatibility}, which has both an integer and a string for
its value, @sc{gnu} attributes have a string value if the tag number is odd and
an integer value if the tag number is even.  The second bit (@code{@var{tag} &
2} is set for architecture-independent attributes and clear for
architecture-dependent ones.

@subsection Common @sc{gnu} attributes

These attributes are valid on all architectures.

@table @r
@item Tag_compatibility (32)
The compatibility attribute takes an integer flag value and a vendor name.  If
the flag value is 0, the file is compatible with other toolchains.  If it is 1,
then the file is only compatible with the named toolchain.  If it is greater
than 1, the file can only be processed by other toolchains under some private
arrangement indicated by the flag value and the vendor name.

@chapter Machine Dependent Features

@cindex machine dependencies
The machine instruction sets are (almost by definition) different on
each machine where @command{@value{AS}} runs.  Floating point representations
vary as well, and @command{@value{AS}} often supports a few additional
directives or command-line options for compatibility with other
assemblers on a particular platform.  Finally, some versions of
@command{@value{AS}} support special pseudo-instructions for branch
optimization.

This chapter discusses most of these differences, though it does not
include details on any machine's instruction set.  For details on that
subject, see the hardware manufacturer's manual.

Your bug reports play an essential role in making @command{@value{AS}} reliable.

Reporting a bug may help you by bringing a solution to your problem, or it may
not.  But in any case the principal function of a bug report is to help the
entire community by making the next version of @command{@value{AS}} work better.
Bug reports are your contribution to the maintenance of @command{@value{AS}}.

In order for a bug report to serve its purpose, you must include the
information that enables us to fix the bug.

@cindex bug criteria

If you are not sure whether you have found a bug, here are some guidelines:

@itemize @bullet
@cindex fatal signal
@cindex assembler crash
@cindex crash of assembler
@item
If the assembler gets a fatal signal, for any input whatever, that is a
@command{@value{AS}} bug.  Reliable assemblers never crash.

@cindex error on valid input
@item
If @command{@value{AS}} produces an error message for valid input, that is a bug.

@cindex invalid input
@item
If @command{@value{AS}} does not produce an error message for invalid input, that
is a bug.  However, you should note that your idea of ``invalid input'' might
be our idea of ``an extension'' or ``support for traditional practice''.

@item
If you are an experienced user of assemblers, your suggestions for improvement
of @command{@value{AS}} are welcome in any case.
@end itemize

@node Bug Reporting
@section How to Report Bugs
@cindex bug reports
@cindex assembler bugs, reporting

A number of companies and individuals offer support for @sc{gnu} products.  If
you obtained @command{@value{AS}} from a support organization, we recommend you
contact that organization first.

You can find contact information for many support companies and
individuals in the file @file{etc/SERVICE} in the @sc{gnu} Emacs
distribution.

@ifset BUGURL
In any event, we also recommend that you send bug reports for @command{@value{AS}}
to @value{BUGURL}.
@end ifset

The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this:
@strong{report all the facts}.  If you are not sure whether to state a
fact or leave it out, state it!

Often people omit facts because they think they know what causes the problem
and assume that some details do not matter.  Thus, you might assume that the
name of a symbol you use in an example does not matter.  Well, probably it does
not, but one cannot be sure.  Perhaps the bug is a stray memory reference which
happens to fetch from the location where that name is stored in memory;
perhaps, if the name were different, the contents of that location would fool
the assembler into doing the right thing despite the bug.  Play it safe and
give a specific, complete example.  That is the easiest thing for you to do,
and the most helpful.

Keep in mind that the purpose of a bug report is to enable us to fix the bug if
it is new to us.  Therefore, always write your bug reports on the assumption
that the bug has not been reported previously.

Sometimes people give a few sketchy facts and ask, ``Does this ring a
bell?''  This cannot help us fix a bug, so it is basically useless.  We
respond by asking for enough details to enable us to investigate.
You might as well expedite matters by sending them to begin with.

To enable us to fix the bug, you should include all these things:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The version of @command{@value{AS}}.  @command{@value{AS}} announces it if you start
it with the @samp{--version} argument.

Without this, we will not know whether there is any point in looking for
the bug in the current version of @command{@value{AS}}.

@item
Any patches you may have applied to the @command{@value{AS}} source.

@item
The type of machine you are using, and the operating system name and
version number.

@item
What compiler (and its version) was used to compile @command{@value{AS}}---e.g.
``@code{gcc-2.7}''.

@item
The command arguments you gave the assembler to assemble your example and
observe the bug.  To guarantee you will not omit something important, list them
all.  A copy of the Makefile (or the output from make) is sufficient.

If we were to try to guess the arguments, we would probably guess wrong
and then we might not encounter the bug.

@item
A complete input file that will reproduce the bug.  If the bug is observed when
the assembler is invoked via a compiler, send the assembler source, not the
high level language source.  Most compilers will produce the assembler source
when run with the @samp{-S} option.  If you are using @code{@value{GCC}}, use
the options @samp{-v --save-temps}; this will save the assembler source in a
file with an extension of @file{.s}, and also show you exactly how
@command{@value{AS}} is being run.

@item
A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
incorrect.  For example, ``It gets a fatal signal.''

Of course, if the bug is that @command{@value{AS}} gets a fatal signal, then we
will certainly notice it.  But if the bug is incorrect output, we might not
notice unless it is glaringly wrong.  You might as well not give us a chance to
make a mistake.

Even if the problem you experience is a fatal signal, you should still say so
explicitly.  Suppose something strange is going on, such as, your copy of
@command{@value{AS}} is out of sync, or you have encountered a bug in the C
library on your system.  (This has happened!)  Your copy might crash and ours
would not.  If you told us to expect a crash, then when ours fails to crash, we
would know that the bug was not happening for us.  If you had not told us to
expect a crash, then we would not be able to draw any conclusion from our
observations.

@item
If you wish to suggest changes to the @command{@value{AS}} source, send us context
diffs, as generated by @code{diff} with the @samp{-u}, @samp{-c}, or @samp{-p}
option.  Always send diffs from the old file to the new file.  If you even
discuss something in the @command{@value{AS}} source, refer to it by context, not
by line number.

The line numbers in our development sources will not match those in your
sources.  Your line numbers would convey no useful information to us.
@end itemize

Here are some things that are not necessary:

@itemize @bullet
@item
A description of the envelope of the bug.

Often people who encounter a bug spend a lot of time investigating
which changes to the input file will make the bug go away and which
changes will not affect it.

This is often time consuming and not very useful, because the way we
will find the bug is by running a single example under the debugger
with breakpoints, not by pure deduction from a series of examples.
We recommend that you save your time for something else.

Of course, if you can find a simpler example to report @emph{instead}
of the original one, that is a convenience for us.  Errors in the
output will be easier to spot, running under the debugger will take
less time, and so on.

However, simplification is not vital; if you do not want to do this,
report the bug anyway and send us the entire test case you used.

@item
A patch for the bug.

A patch for the bug does help us if it is a good one.  But do not omit
the necessary information, such as the test case, on the assumption that
a patch is all we need.  We might see problems with your patch and decide
to fix the problem another way, or we might not understand it at all.

Sometimes with a program as complicated as @command{@value{AS}} it is very hard to
construct an example that will make the program follow a certain path through
the code.  If you do not send us the example, we will not be able to construct
one, so we will not be able to verify that the bug is fixed.

And if we cannot understand what bug you are trying to fix, or why your
patch should be an improvement, we will not install it.  A test case will
help us to understand.

@item
A guess about what the bug is or what it depends on.

Such guesses are usually wrong.  Even we cannot guess right about such
things without first using the debugger to find the facts.

@chapter Acknowledgements

If you have contributed to GAS and your name isn't listed here,
it is not meant as a slight.  We just don't know about it.  Send mail to the
maintainer, and we'll correct the situation.  Currently
@c (October 2012),
the maintainer is Nick Clifton (email address @code{nickc@@redhat.com}).

Dean Elsner wrote the original @sc{gnu} assembler for the VAX.@footnote{Any
more details?}

Jay Fenlason maintained GAS for a while, adding support for GDB-specific debug
information and the 68k series machines, most of the preprocessing pass, and
extensive changes in @file{messages.c}, @file{input-file.c}, @file{write.c}.

K. Richard Pixley maintained GAS for a while, adding various enhancements and
many bug fixes, including merging support for several processors, breaking GAS
up to handle multiple object file format back ends (including heavy rewrite,
testing, an integration of the coff and b.out back ends), adding configuration
including heavy testing and verification of cross assemblers and file splits
and renaming, converted GAS to strictly ANSI C including full prototypes, added
support for m680[34]0 and cpu32, did considerable work on i960 including a COFF
port (including considerable amounts of reverse engineering), a SPARC opcode
file rewrite, DECstation, rs6000, and hp300hpux host ports, updated ``know''
assertions and made them work, much other reorganization, cleanup, and lint.

Ken Raeburn wrote the high-level BFD interface code to replace most of the code
in format-specific I/O modules.

The original VMS support was contributed by David L. Kashtan.  Eric Youngdale
has done much work with it since.

The Intel 80386 machine description was written by Eliot Dresselhaus.

Minh Tran-Le at IntelliCorp contributed some AIX 386 support.

The Motorola 88k machine description was contributed by Devon Bowen of Buffalo
University and Torbjorn Granlund of the Swedish Institute of Computer Science.

Keith Knowles at the Open Software Foundation wrote the original MIPS back end
(@file{tc-mips.c}, @file{tc-mips.h}), and contributed Rose format support
(which hasn't been merged in yet).  Ralph Campbell worked with the MIPS code to
support a.out format.

Support for the Zilog Z8k and Renesas H8/300 processors (tc-z8k,
tc-h8300), and IEEE 695 object file format (obj-ieee), was written by
Steve Chamberlain of Cygnus Support.  Steve also modified the COFF back end to
use BFD for some low-level operations, for use with the H8/300 and AMD 29k
targets.

John Gilmore built the AMD 29000 support, added @code{.include} support, and
simplified the configuration of which versions accept which directives.  He
updated the 68k machine description so that Motorola's opcodes always produced
fixed-size instructions (e.g., @code{jsr}), while synthetic instructions
remained shrinkable (@code{jbsr}).  John fixed many bugs, including true tested
cross-compilation support, and one bug in relaxation that took a week and
required the proverbial one-bit fix.

Ian Lance Taylor of Cygnus Support merged the Motorola and MIT syntax for the
68k, completed support for some COFF targets (68k, i386 SVR3, and SCO Unix),
added support for MIPS ECOFF and ELF targets, wrote the initial RS/6000 and
PowerPC assembler, and made a few other minor patches.

Steve Chamberlain made GAS able to generate listings.

Hewlett-Packard contributed support for the HP9000/300.

Jeff Law wrote GAS and BFD support for the native HPPA object format (SOM)
along with a fairly extensive HPPA testsuite (for both SOM and ELF object
formats).  This work was supported by both the Center for Software Science at
the University of Utah and Cygnus Support.

Support for ELF format files has been worked on by Mark Eichin of Cygnus
Support (original, incomplete implementation for SPARC), Pete Hoogenboom and
Jeff Law at the University of Utah (HPPA mainly), Michael Meissner of the Open
Software Foundation (i386 mainly), and Ken Raeburn of Cygnus Support (sparc,
and some initial 64-bit support).

Linas Vepstas added GAS support for the ESA/390 ``IBM 370'' architecture.

Richard Henderson rewrote the Alpha assembler. Klaus Kaempf wrote GAS and BFD
support for openVMS/Alpha.

Timothy Wall, Michael Hayes, and Greg Smart contributed to the various tic*
flavors.

David Heine, Sterling Augustine, Bob Wilson and John Ruttenberg from Tensilica,
Inc.@: added support for Xtensa processors.

Several engineers at Cygnus Support have also provided many small bug fixes and
configuration enhancements.

Jon Beniston added support for the Lattice Mico32 architecture.

Many others have contributed large or small bugfixes and enhancements.  If
you have contributed significant work and are not mentioned on this list, and
want to be, let us know.  Some of the history has been lost; we are not
intentionally leaving anyone out.
