@chapter Clang/LLVM Command Options
@cindex LLVM command options
@cindex Clang/LLVM command options
@cindex command options
@cindex options, LLVM command
@cindex options, Clang command

@c man begin DESCRIPTION
When you invoke Clang/LLVM, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
assembly and linking.  The ``overall options'' allow you to stop this
process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the @option{-c} option
says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files
output by the assembler.

Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.  Some options
control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.

Clang/LLVM is invoked by the @command{clang} command for C/ObjectiveC
and by the @command{clang++} command for C++/ObjectiveC++.  Unlike
GCC, a LLVM compiler is usually built to support @emph{all} backends,
and by default @command{clang} or @command{clang++} will compile for
the architecture on which it is running (the @dfn{native} target).
Clang/LLVM can be used as a cross-compiler by using the @option{-mcpu}
option.  Alternatively the @command{clang} and @command{clang++}
commands can be renamed or symbolically linked to
@command{@var{arch}-cc} and @command{@var{arch}-c++} respectively,
when they will compile for the architecture @var{arch}.  So for
example the following will both cross-compile for the MIPS
architecture.

@smallexample
clang -mcpu=mips ...
mips-cc ...
@end smallexample

@cindex C compilation options
Most of the command-line options that you can use with LLVM are useful
for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language
(usually C++), the explanation says so explicitly.  If the description
for a particular option does not mention a source language, you can use
that option with all supported languages.

@cindex C++ compilation options
@xref{Invoking Clang/LLVM for C++,,Compiling C++ Programs}, for a
summary of special options for compiling C++ programs.

@cindex grouping options
@cindex options, grouping
The @command{clang} program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter options
may @emph{not} be grouped: @option{-dv} is very different from @w{@samp{-d
-v}}.

@cindex order of options
@cindex options, order
You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the order
you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several
options of the same kind; for example, if you specify @option{-L} more
than once, the directories are searched in the order specified.  Also,
the placement of the @option{-l} option is significant.

Many options have long names starting with @samp{-f} or with
@samp{-W}---for example,
@option{-fmove-loop-invariants}, @option{-Wformat} and so on.  Most of
these have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
@option{-ffoo} is @option{-fno-foo}.  This manual documents
only one of these two forms, whichever one is not the default.

@section Options Controlling the Kind of Output

Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.  Clang/LLVM is capable of
preprocessing and compiling several files either into several
assembler input files, or into one assembler input file; then each
assembler input file produces an object file, and linking combines all
the object files (those newly compiled, and those specified as input)
into an executable file.

@emph{Note:} Not all GCC options are supported by Clang/LLVM.

@end itemize

@cindex file name suffix
For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of
compilation is done:

@table @gcctabopt
@item @var{file}.c
C source code that must be preprocessed.

@item @var{file}.i
C source code that should not be preprocessed.

@item @var{file}.ii
C++ source code that should not be preprocessed.

@item @var{file}.m
Objective-C source code.  Note that you must link with the @file{libobjc}
library to make an Objective-C program work.

@item @var{file}.mi
Objective-C source code that should not be preprocessed.

@item @var{file}.mm
@itemx @var{file}.M
Objective-C++ source code.  Note that you must link with the @file{libobjc}
library to make an Objective-C++ program work.  Note that @samp{.M} refers
to a literal capital M@.

@item @var{file}.mii
Objective-C++ source code that should not be preprocessed.

@item @var{file}.h
C, C++, Objective-C or Objective-C++ header file to be turned into a
precompiled header (default), or C, C++ header file to be turned into an
Ada spec (via the @option{-fdump-ada-spec} switch).

@item @var{file}.cc
@itemx @var{file}.cp
@itemx @var{file}.cxx
@itemx @var{file}.cpp
@itemx @var{file}.CPP
@itemx @var{file}.c++
@itemx @var{file}.C
C++ source code that must be preprocessed.  Note that in @samp{.cxx},
the last two letters must both be literally @samp{x}.  Likewise,
@samp{.C} refers to a literal capital C@.

@item @var{file}.mm
@itemx @var{file}.M
Objective-C++ source code that must be preprocessed.

@item @var{file}.mii
Objective-C++ source code that should not be preprocessed.

@item @var{file}.hh

@itemx @var{file}.hp
@itemx @var{file}.hxx
@itemx @var{file}.hpp
@itemx @var{file}.HPP
@itemx @var{file}.h++
@itemx @var{file}.tcc
C++ header file to be turned into a precompiled header.

@c Unlike GCC, LLVM does not know about some suffixes for languages
@c not yet included:
@c Pascal:
@c @var{file}.p
@c @var{file}.pas
@c Ratfor:
@c @var{file}.r

@item @var{file}.s
Assembler code.

@item @var{file}.S
@itemx @var{file}.sx
Assembler code that must be preprocessed.

@item @var{other}
An object file to be fed straight into linking.
Any file name with no recognized suffix is treated this way.
@end table

The following Clang/LLVM options provide overall control of the type
of output from the compiler.

@table @gcctabopt
@item @@@var{file}
@opindex @@
Read command-line options from @var{file}.  The options read are
inserted in place of the original @@@var{file} option.  If @var{file}
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.

Options in @var{file} are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The @var{file} may itself contain additional
@@@var{file} options; any such options will be processed recursively.

@item -###
@opindex ###
Like @option{-v} except the commands are not executed and arguments
are quoted unless they contain only alphanumeric characters or @code{./-_}.
This is useful for shell scripts to capture the driver-generated command lines.

@item -c
@opindex c
Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking
stage simply is not done.  The ultimate output is in the form of an
object file for each source file.

By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing
the suffix @samp{.c}, @samp{.i}, @samp{.s}, etc., with @samp{.o}.

Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly, are
ignored.

@item -E
@opindex E
Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper.  The
output is in the form of preprocessed source code, which is sent to the
standard output.

Input files that don't require preprocessing are ignored.

@item -emit-ast
@opindex emit-ast
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -emit-llvm
@opindex emit-llvm
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -fbuild-session-file=@var{file}

@item -fbuild-session-timestamp=@var{secs}
@opindex fbuild-session-timestamp
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -fplugin=@var{name}.so
@opindex fplugin
Load the plugin code in file @var{name}.so, assumed to be a shared
object to be dlopen'd by the compiler.

@emph{Note:} Unlike GCC, Clang/LLVM has no mechansim equivalent to
@option{-fplugin-arg} to pass arguments to callbacks.

@item --gcc-toolchain=@var{dir}
@opindex gcc-toolchain
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item --help
@itemx -help
@opindex help
Print (on the standard output) a description of the command-line options
understood by @command{clang}.  If the @option{-v} option is also specified
then @option{--help} is also passed on to the various processes
invoked by @command{clang}, so that they can display the command-line options
they accept.  If the @option{-Wextra} option has also been specified
(prior to the @option{--help} option), then command-line options that
have no documentation associated with them are also displayed.

@emph{Note:} The @option{-help} (with a single hyphen) is a Clang/LLVM
specific variant

@item -o @var{file}
@cindex output file option
@opindex o
Place output in file @var{file}.  This applies to whatever
sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file,
an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.

If @option{-o} is not specified, the default is to put an executable
file in @file{a.out}, the object file for
@file{@var{source}.@var{suffix}} in @file{@var{source}.o}, its
assembler file in @file{@var{source}.s}, a precompiled header file in
@file{@var{source}.@var{suffix}.gch}, and all preprocessed C source on
standard output.

@item -ObjC
@opindex ObjC
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -ObjC++
@opindex ObjC++
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -pipe
@opindex pipe
Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication between the
various stages of compilation.  This fails to work on some systems where
the assembler is unable to read from a pipe; but GNU assemblers have
no trouble.  It is also not an issue where the Clang/LLVM integrated
assembler is used.

@item -Qunused-arguments
@opindex Qunused-arguments
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -S
@opindex S
Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.  The output
is in the form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler input
file specified.

By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by
replacing the suffix @samp{.c}, @samp{.i}, etc., with @samp{.s}.

Input files that don't require compilation are ignored.

@item -v
@opindex v
Print (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the stages
of compilation.  Also print the version number of the compiler driver
program and of the preprocessor and the compiler proper.

@item --version
@opindex version
Display the version number and copyrights of the invoked Clang/LLVM@.

@item -working-directory @var{dir}
@opindex working-directory
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -x @var{language}
@opindex x
You can specify the input language explicitly with the @option{-x} option:

Specify explicitly the @var{language} for the following input files
(rather than letting the compiler choose a default based on the file
name suffix).  This option applies to all following input files until
the next @option{-x} option.  Possible values for @var{language} are:
@smallexample
c  c-header  cpp-output
c++  c++-header  c++-cpp-output
objective-c  objective-c-header  objective-c-cpp-output
objective-c++ objective-c++-header objective-c++-cpp-output
assembler  assembler-with-cpp
@end smallexample

@item -x none
Turn off any specification of a language, so that subsequent files are
handled according to their file name suffixes (as they are if @option{-x}
has not been used at all).

@item -Xclang
@opindex Xclang
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@node Invoking Clang/LLVM for C++
@section Compiling C++ Programs

@cindex suffixes for C++ source
@cindex C++ source file suffixes
C++ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes @samp{.C},
@samp{.cc}, @samp{.cpp}, @samp{.CPP}, @samp{.c++}, @samp{.cp}, or
@samp{.cxx}; C++ header files often use @samp{.hh}, @samp{.hpp},
@samp{.H}, or (for shared template code) @samp{.tcc}; and preprocessed
C++ files use the suffix @samp{.ii}.  Clang/LLVM recognizes files with
these names and compiles them as C++ programs even if you call the
compiler the same way as for compiling C programs.

@findex clang++
However, the use of @command{clang} does not add the C++ library.
@command{clang++} is a program that automatically specifies linking
against the C++ library.  It treats @samp{.c}, @samp{.h} and @samp{.i}
files as C++ source files instead of C source files unless @option{-x}
is used.  This program is also useful when precompiling a C header
file with a @samp{.h} extension for use in C++ compilations.  Target
specific variants will also be installed as @command{@var{arch}-c++}.

@cindex invoking @command{clang++}
When you compile C++ programs, you may specify many of the same
command-line options that you use for compiling programs in any
language; or command-line options meaningful for C and related
languages; or options that are meaningful only for C++ programs.
@xref{C Dialect Options,,Options Controlling C Dialect}, for

that the compiler accepts:

@end itemize

@table @gcctabopt
@cindex ANSI support
@cindex ISO support
@item -ansi
@opindex ansi
In C mode, this is equivalent to @option{-std=c90}. In C++ mode, it is
equivalent to @option{-std=c++98}.

This turns off certain features of Clang/LLVM that are incompatible with ISO
C90 (when compiling C code), or of standard C++ (when compiling C++ code),
such as the @code{asm} and @code{typeof} keywords, and
predefined macros such as @code{unix} and @code{vax} that identify the
type of system you are using.  It also enables the undesirable and
rarely used ISO trigraph feature.  For the C compiler,
it disables recognition of C++ style @samp{//} comments as well as
the @code{inline} keyword.

The alternate keywords @code{__asm__}, @code{__extension__},
@code{__inline__} and @code{__typeof__} continue to work despite
@option{-ansi}.  You would not want to use them in an ISO C program, of
course, but it is useful to put them in header files that might be included
in compilations done with @option{-ansi}.  Alternate predefined macros
such as @code{__unix__} and @code{__vax__} are also available, with or
without @option{-ansi}.

The @option{-ansi} option does not cause non-ISO programs to be
rejected gratuitously.  For that, @option{-Wpedantic} is required in
addition to @option{-ansi}.  @xref{Warning Options}.

The macro @code{__STRICT_ANSI__} is predefined when the @option{-ansi}
option is used.  Some header files may notice this macro and refrain
from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the
ISO standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with any
programs that might use these names for other things.

Functions that are normally built in but do not have semantics
defined by ISO C (such as @code{alloca} and @code{ffs}) are not built-in
functions when @option{-ansi} is used.  @xref{Other Builtins,,Other
built-in functions provided by LLVM}, for details of the functions
affected.

@item -fno-asm
@opindex fno-asm
Do not recognize @code{asm}, @code{inline} or @code{typeof} as a
keyword, so that code can use these words as identifiers.  You can use
the keywords @code{__asm__}, @code{__inline__} and @code{__typeof__}
instead.  @option{-ansi} implies @option{-fno-asm}.

In C++, this switch only affects the @code{typeof} keyword, since
@code{asm} and @code{inline} are standard keywords.  You may want to
use the @option{-fno-gnu-keywords} flag instead, which has the same
effect.  In C99 mode (@option{-std=c99} or @option{-std=gnu99}), this
switch only affects the @code{asm} and @code{typeof} keywords, since
@code{inline} is a standard keyword in ISO C99.

@item -fblocks
@opindex fblocks
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -fborland-extensions
@opindex fborland-extensions
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -fno-builtin
@itemx -fno-builtin-@var{function}
@opindex fno-builtin
@cindex built-in functions
Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with
@samp{__builtin_} as prefix.  @xref{Other Builtins,,Other built-in
functions provided by LLVM}, for details of the functions affected,
including those which are not built-in functions when @option{-ansi} or
@option{-std} options for strict ISO C conformance are used because they
do not have an ISO standard meaning.

Clang/LLVM normally generates special code to handle certain built-in functions
more efficiently; for instance, calls to @code{alloca} may become single
instructions which adjust the stack directly, and calls to @code{memcpy}
may become inline copy loops.  The resulting code is often both smaller
and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you
cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior
of the functions by linking with a different library.  In addition,
when a function is recognized as a built-in function, Clang/LLVM may use
information about that function to warn about problems with calls to
that function, or to generate more efficient code, even if the
resulting code still contains calls to that function.  For example,
warnings are given with @option{-Wformat} for bad calls to
@code{printf} when @code{printf} is built in and @code{strlen} is
known not to modify global memory.

With the @option{-fno-builtin-@var{function}} option
only the built-in function @var{function} is
disabled.  @var{function} must not begin with @samp{__builtin_}.  If a
function is named that is not built-in in this version of Clang/LLVM, this
option is ignored.  There is no corresponding
@option{-fbuiltin-@var{function}} option; if you wish to enable
built-in functions selectively when using @option{-fno-builtin} or
@option{-ffreestanding}, you may define macros such as:

@smallexample
#define abs(n)          __builtin_abs ((n))
#define strcpy(d, s)    __builtin_strcpy ((d), (s))
@end smallexample

@item -femit-all-decls
@opindex femit-all-decls
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -ffreestanding
@opindex ffreestanding
@cindex hosted environment

Assert that compilation targets a freestanding environment.  This
implies @option{-fno-builtin}.  A freestanding environment
is one in which the standard library may not exist, and program startup may
not necessarily be at @code{main}.  The most obvious example is an OS kernel.
This is equivalent to @option{-fno-hosted}.

@xref{Standards,,Language Standards Supported by LLVM}, for details of
freestanding and hosted environments.

@item -fgnu89-inline
@opindex fgnu89-inline
The option @option{-fgnu89-inline} tells Clang/LLVM to use the
traditional GNU semantics for @code{inline} functions when in C99
mode.  @xref{Inline,,An Inline Function is As Fast As a Macro}.  Using
this option is roughly equivalent to adding the @code{gnu_inline}
function attribute to all inline functions (@pxref{Function
Attributes}).

The option @option{-fno-gnu89-inline} explicitly tells Clang/LLVM to
use the C99 semantics for @code{inline} when in C99 or gnu99 mode
(i.e., it specifies the default behavior).  This option is not
supported in @option{-std=c90} or @option{-std=gnu90} mode.

The preprocessor macros @code{__GNUC_GNU_INLINE__} and
@code{__GNUC_STDC_INLINE__} may be used to check which semantics are
in effect for @code{inline} functions.  @xref{Common Predefined
Macros,,,cpp,The C Preprocessor}.

@item -fno-gnu-inline-asm
@opindex fno-gnu-inline-asm
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -fhosted
@opindex fhosted
@cindex hosted environment

Assert that compilation targets a hosted environment.  This implies
@option{-fbuiltin}.  A hosted environment is one in which the
entire standard library is available, and in which @code{main} has a return
type of @code{int}.  Examples are nearly everything except a kernel.
This is equivalent to @option{-fno-freestanding}.

@item -flax-vector-conversions
@opindex flax-vector-conversions
Allow implicit conversions between vectors with differing numbers of
elements and/or incompatible element types.  This option should not be
used for new code.

@item -fms-compatibility
@opindex fms-compatibility

Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.  Also valid for C++.

@item -fms-compatibility-version=@var{n}
@opindex fms-compatibility-version

Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.  Also valid for C++.

@item -fms-extensions
@opindex fms-extensions
Accept some non-standard constructs used in Microsoft header files.

In C++ code, this allows member names in structures to be similar
to previous types declarations.

@smallexample
typedef int UOW;
struct ABC @{
  UOW UOW;
@};
@end smallexample

Some cases of unnamed fields in structures and unions are only
accepted with this option.  @xref{Unnamed Fields,,Unnamed struct/union
fields within structs/unions}, for details.

Note that this option is off for all targets but x86
targets using ms-abi.

@item -fmsc-version=@var{n}
@opindex fmsc-version

Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.  Also valid for C++.

@item -fopenmp
@opindex fopenmp
@cindex OpenMP parallel
Enable handling of OpenMP directives @code{#pragma omp} in C/C++.
When @option{-fopenmp} is specified, the compiler generates parallel
code according to the OpenMP Application Program Interface v4.0
@w{@uref{http://www.openmp.org/}}.  This option implies
@option{-pthread}, and thus is only supported on targets that have
support for @option{-pthread}.  Unlike GCC there is no
@option{-fopenmp-simd}, which would be implied by @option{-fopenmp}.

@item -fpascal-strings
@opindex fpascal-strings
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -fsigned-bitfields
@itemx -funsigned-bitfields
@itemx -fno-signed-bitfields
@itemx -fno-unsigned-bitfields
@opindex fsigned-bitfields
@opindex funsigned-bitfields
@opindex fno-signed-bitfields
@opindex fno-unsigned-bitfields
These options control whether a bit-field is signed or unsigned, when the
declaration does not use either @code{signed} or @code{unsigned}.  By
default, such a bit-field is signed, because this is consistent: the
basic integer types such as @code{int} are signed types.

@item -fsigned-char
@opindex fsigned-char
Let the type @code{char} be signed, like @code{signed char}.

Note that this is equivalent to @option{-fno-unsigned-char}, which is
the negative form of @option{-funsigned-char}.  Likewise, the option
@option{-fno-signed-char} is equivalent to @option{-funsigned-char}.

@item -fno-spell-checking
@opindex fno-spell-checking
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -std=
@opindex std
Determine the language standard. @xref{Standards,,Language Standards
Supported by LLVM}, for details of these standard versions.  This option
is currently only supported when compiling C or C++.

The compiler can accept several base standards, such as @samp{c90} or
@samp{c++98}, and GNU dialects of those standards, such as
@samp{gnu90} or @samp{gnu++98}.  When a base standard is specified, the
compiler accepts all programs following that standard plus those
using GNU extensions that do not contradict it.  For example,
@option{-std=c90} turns off certain features of Clang/LLVM that are
incompatible with ISO C90, such as the @code{asm} and @code{typeof}
keywords, but not other GNU extensions that do not have a meaning in
ISO C90, such as omitting the middle term of a @code{?:}
expression. On the other hand, when a GNU dialect of a standard is
specified, all features supported by the compiler are enabled, even when
those features change the meaning of the base standard.  As a result, some
strict-conforming programs may be rejected.  The particular standard
is used by @option{-Wpedantic} to identify which features are GNU
extensions given that version of the standard. For example
@option{-std=gnu90 -Wpedantic} warns about C++ style @samp{//}
comments, while @option{-std=gnu99 -Wpedantic} does not.

A value for this option must be provided; possible values are

@table @samp
@item c90
@itemx c89
@itemx iso9899:1990
Support all ISO C90 programs (certain GNU extensions that conflict
with ISO C90 are disabled). Same as @option{-ansi} for C code.

@item iso9899:199409
ISO C90 as modified in amendment 1.

@item c99
@itemx c9x
@itemx iso9899:1999
@itemx iso9899:199x
ISO C99.  This standard is substantially completely supported, modulo
bugs and floating-point issues
(mainly but not entirely relating to optional C99 features from
Annexes F and G).  See
@w{@uref{http://gcc.gnu.org/c99status.html}} for more information.  The
names @samp{c9x} and @samp{iso9899:199x} are deprecated.

@item c11
@itemx c1x
@itemx iso9899:2011
ISO C11, the 2011 revision of the ISO C standard.  This standard is
substantially completely supported, modulo bugs, floating-point issues
(mainly but not entirely relating to optional C11 features from
Annexes F and G) and the optional Annexes K (Bounds-checking
interfaces) and L (Analyzability).  The name @samp{c1x} is deprecated.

@item gnu90
@itemx gnu89
GNU dialect of ISO C90 (including some C99 features).

@item gnu99
@itemx gnu9x
GNU dialect of ISO C99.  The name @samp{gnu9x} is deprecated.

@item gnu11
@itemx gnu1x
GNU dialect of ISO C11.  This is the default for C code.
The name @samp{gnu1x} is deprecated.

@item c++98
@itemx c++03
The 1998 ISO C++ standard plus the 2003 technical corrigendum and some
additional defect reports. Same as @option{-ansi} for C++ code.

@item gnu++98
@itemx gnu++03
GNU dialect of @option{-std=c++98}.

@item c++11
@itemx c++0x
The 2011 ISO C++ standard plus amendments.
The name @samp{c++0x} is deprecated.

@item gnu++11
@itemx gnu++0x
GNU dialect of @option{-std=c++11}.
The name @samp{gnu++0x} is deprecated.

@item c++14
@itemx c++1y
The 2014 ISO C++ standard plus amendments.
The name @samp{c++1y} is deprecated.

@item gnu++14
@itemx gnu++1y
GNU dialect of @option{-std=c++14}.
This is the default for C++ code.
The name @samp{gnu++1y} is deprecated.

@item c++1z
The next revision of the ISO C++ standard, tentatively planned for
2017.  Support is highly experimental, and will almost certainly
change in incompatible ways in future releases.

@item gnu++1z
GNU dialect of @option{-std=c++1z}.  Support is highly experimental,
and will almost certainly change in incompatible ways in future
releases.
@end table

@cindex traditional C language
@cindex C language, traditional
@item -traditional
@opindex traditional
This option caused older versions of GCC to attempt to emulate a
pre-standard C compiler.  On both GCC and Clang/LLVM is is now only
supported with the @option{-E} switch.  The preprocessor continues to
support a pre-standard mode.  @xref{Preprocessor Options}.

@emph{Note:} The GCC option @option{-traditional-cpp} is not supported
by Clang/LLVM.

@item -trigraphs
@opindex trigraphs
Support ISO C trigraphs.  The @option{-ansi} option (and @option{-std}
options for strict ISO C conformance) implies @option{-trigraphs}.

@item -funique-section-names
@opindex funique-section-names
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -funsigned-char
@opindex funsigned-char
Let the type @code{char} be unsigned, like @code{unsigned char}.

Each kind of machine has a default for what @code{char} should
be.  It is either like @code{unsigned char} by default or like
@code{signed char} by default.

Ideally, a portable program should always use @code{signed char} or
@code{unsigned char} when it depends on the signedness of an object.
But many programs have been written to use plain @code{char} and
expect it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the
machines they were written for.  This option, and its inverse, let you
make such a program work with the opposite default.

The type @code{char} is always a distinct type from each of
@code{signed char} or @code{unsigned char}, even though its behavior
is always just like one of those two.

@item -fwritable-strings
@opindex fwritable-strings
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@node C++ Dialect Options
@section Options Controlling C++ Dialect
@cindex compiler options, C++
@cindex C++ options, command-line
@cindex options, C++

This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for C++ programs.  You can also use most of the Clang/LLVM compiler options
regardless of what language your program is in.  For example, you
might compile a file @file{firstClass.C} like this:

@smallexample
clang++ -g -frepo -O -c firstClass.C
@end smallexample

@noindent
In this example, only @option{-frepo} is an option meant
only for C++ programs; you can use the other options with any
language supported by LLVM@.

@emph{Note:} Not all GCC options are supported by Clang/LLVM.
@xref{Option Summary,,Option Summary}, for details of:
@itemize @bullet
@item
those options supported by both Clang/LLVM and GCC;
@item
those options only supported by Clang/LLVM; and
@item
those options supported only by GCC.
@end itemize

Here is a list of Clang/LLVM options that are @emph{only} for
compiling C++ programs:

@table @gcctabopt

@item -fno-access-control
@opindex fno-access-control
Turn off all access checking.  This switch is mainly useful for working
around bugs in the access control code.

@item -fno-assume-sane-operator-new
@opindex fno-assume-sane-operator-new
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -fcheck-new
@opindex fcheck-new
Check that the pointer returned by @code{operator new} is non-null
before attempting to modify the storage allocated.  This check is
normally unnecessary because the C++ standard specifies that
@code{operator new} only returns @code{0} if it is declared
@code{throw()}, in which case the compiler always checks the
return value even without this option.  In all other cases, when
@code{operator new} has a non-empty exception specification, memory
exhaustion is signalled by throwing @code{std::bad_alloc}.  See also
@samp{new (nothrow)}.

@item -fconstexpr-depth=@var{n}
@opindex fconstexpr-depth
Set the maximum nested evaluation depth for C++11 constexpr functions
to @var{n}.  A limit is needed to detect endless recursion during
constant expression evaluation.  The minimum specified by the standard
is 512.

@item -fcxx-exceptions
@opindex fcxx-exceptions
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -fdelayed-template-parsing
@opindex fdelayed-template-parsing
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -fno-elide-constructors
@opindex fno-elide-constructors
The C++ standard allows an implementation to omit creating a temporary
that is only used to initialize another object of the same type.
Specifying this option disables that optimization, and forces G++ to
call the copy constructor in all cases.

@item -ffor-scope
@itemx -fno-for-scope
@opindex ffor-scope
@opindex fno-for-scope
If @option{-ffor-scope} is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a @i{for-init-statement} is limited to the @code{for} loop itself,
as specified by the C++ standard.
If @option{-fno-for-scope} is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a @i{for-init-statement} extends to the end of the enclosing scope,
as was the case in old versions of G++, and other (traditional)
implementations of C++.

If neither flag is given, the default is to follow the standard,
but to allow and give a warning for old-style code that would
otherwise be invalid, or have different behavior.

@item -ffriend-injection
@opindex ffriend-injection
Inject friend functions into the enclosing namespace, so that they are
visible outside the scope of the class in which they are declared.
Friend functions were documented to work this way in the old Annotated
C++ Reference Manual.

However, in ISO C++ a friend function that is not declared
in an enclosing scope can only be found using argument dependent
lookup.  Clang/LLVM defaults to the standard behavior.

This option is for compatibility, and may be removed in a future
release of Clang/LLVM.

@item -fno-gnu-keywords
@opindex fno-gnu-keywords
Do not recognize @code{typeof} as a keyword, so that code can use this
word as an identifier.  You can use the keyword @code{__typeof__} instead.
@option{-ansi} implies @option{-fno-gnu-keywords}.

@item -fno-implicit-templates
@opindex fno-implicit-templates
Never emit code for non-inline templates that are instantiated
implicitly (i.e.@: by use); only emit code for explicit instantiations.
@xref{Template Instantiation}, for more information.

@item -fno-implement-inlines
@opindex fno-implement-inlines
To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline functions
controlled by @code{#pragma implementation}.  This causes linker
errors if these functions are not inlined everywhere they are called.

@item -fno-operator-names
@opindex fno-operator-names
Do not treat the operator name keywords @code{and}, @code{bitand},
@code{bitor}, @code{compl}, @code{not}, @code{or} and @code{xor} as
synonyms as keywords.

@item -fpermissive
@opindex fpermissive
Downgrade some diagnostics about nonconformant code from errors to
warnings.  Thus, using @option{-fpermissive} allows some
nonconforming code to compile.

@item -fno-rtti
@opindex fno-rtti
Disable generation of information about every class with virtual
functions for use by the C++ run-time type identification features
(@code{dynamic_cast} and @code{typeid}).  If you don't use those parts
of the language, you can save some space by using this flag.  Note that
exception handling uses the same information, but G++ generates it as
needed. The @code{dynamic_cast} operator can still be used for casts that
do not require run-time type information, i.e.@: casts to @code{void *} or to
unambiguous base classes.

@item -fsized-deallocation
@opindex fsized-deallocation
Enable the built-in global declarations
@smallexample
void operator delete (void *, std::size_t) noexcept;
void operator delete[] (void *, std::size_t) noexcept;
@end smallexample
as introduced in C++14.  This is useful for user-defined replacement
deallocation functions that, for example, use the size of the object
to make deallocation faster.  Enabled by default under
@option{-std=c++14} and above.  The flag @option{-Wsized-deallocation}
warns about places that might want to add a definition.

@item -fshow-overloads=@var{opt}
@opindex fshow-overloads

Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.  Permitted values of
@var{opt} are @option{all} and @option{best}.

@item -ftemplate-backtrace-limit=@var{n}
@opindex ftemplate-backtrace-limit
Set the maximum number of template instantiation notes for a single
warning or error to @var{n}.  The default value is 10.

@item -ftemplate-depth=@var{n}
@opindex ftemplate-depth
Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to @var{n}.
A limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to detect
endless recursions during template class instantiation.  ANSI/ISO C++
conforming programs must not rely on a maximum depth greater than 17
(changed to 1024 in C++11).  The default value is 900, as the compiler
can run out of stack space before hitting 1024 in some situations.

@item -fno-threadsafe-statics
@opindex fno-threadsafe-statics
Do not emit the extra code to use the routines specified in the C++
ABI for thread-safe initialization of local statics.  You can use this
option to reduce code size slightly in code that doesn't need to be
thread-safe.

@item -fuse-cxa-atexit
@opindex fuse-cxa-atexit
Register destructors for objects with static storage duration with the
@code{__cxa_atexit} function rather than the @code{atexit} function.
This option is required for fully standards-compliant handling of static
destructors, but only works if your C library supports
@code{__cxa_atexit}.

@item -fvisibility-inlines-hidden
@opindex fvisibility-inlines-hidden
This switch declares that the user does not attempt to compare
pointers to inline functions or methods where the addresses of the two functions
are taken in different shared objects.

The effect of this is that Clang/LLVM may, effectively, mark inline methods with
@code{__attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden")))} so that they do not
appear in the export table of a DSO and do not require a PLT indirection
when used within the DSO@.  Enabling this option can have a dramatic effect
on load and link times of a DSO as it massively reduces the size of the
dynamic export table when the library makes heavy use of templates.

The behavior of this switch is not quite the same as marking the
methods as hidden directly, because it does not affect static variables
local to the function or cause the compiler to deduce that
the function is defined in only one shared object.

You may mark a method as having a visibility explicitly to negate the
effect of the switch for that method.  For example, if you do want to
compare pointers to a particular inline method, you might mark it as
having default visibility.  Marking the enclosing class with explicit
visibility has no effect.

Explicitly instantiated inline methods are unaffected by this option
as their linkage might otherwise cross a shared library boundary.
@xref{Template Instantiation}.

@item -fvisibility-ms-compat
@opindex fvisibility-ms-compat
This flag attempts to use visibility settings to make Clang/LLVM's C++
linkage model compatible with that of Microsoft Visual Studio.

The flag makes these changes to Clang/LLVM's linkage model:

@enumerate
@item
It sets the default visibility to @code{hidden}, like
@option{-fvisibility=hidden}.

@item
Types, but not their members, are not hidden by default.

@item
The One Definition Rule is relaxed for types without explicit
visibility specifications that are defined in more than one
shared object: those declarations are permitted if they are
permitted when this option is not used.
@end enumerate

In new code it is better to use @option{-fvisibility=hidden} and
export those classes that are intended to be externally visible.
Unfortunately it is possible for code to rely, perhaps accidentally,
on the Visual Studio behavior.

Among the consequences of these changes are that static data members
of the same type with the same name but defined in different shared
objects are different, so changing one does not change the other;
and that pointers to function members defined in different shared
objects may not compare equal.  When this flag is given, it is a
violation of the ODR to define types with the same name differently.

@item -nostdinc++
@opindex nostdinc++
Do not search for header files in the standard directories specific to
C++, but do still search the other standard directories.  (This option
is used when building the C++ library.)
@end table

In addition, these optimization, warning, and code generation options
have meanings only for C++ programs:

@table @gcctabopt
@item -Wabi @r{(C++ and Objective-C++ only)}
@opindex Wabi
@opindex Wno-abi
Warn when Clang/LLVM it generates code that is probably not compatible
with the vendor-neutral C++ ABI@.  Normally @option{-Wabi} will warn
only if there is a check added later in a release series for an ABI
issue discovered since the initial release.  Unlike GCC, there is no
option @option{-fabi-version=@var{n}}) to select an older ABI, nor is
there an option to warn about an explicit version number,
@option{-Wabi=@var{n}}.

Although an effort has been made to warn about
all such cases, there are probably some cases that are not warned about,
even though Clang/LLVM is generating incompatible code.  There may also be
cases where warnings are emitted even though the code that is generated
is compatible.

You should rewrite your code to avoid these warnings if you are
concerned about the fact that code generated by G++ may not be binary
compatible with code generated by other compilers.

@item -Wno-conversion-null @r{(C++ and Objective-C++ only)}
@opindex Wconversion-null
@opindex Wno-conversion-null
Do not warn for conversions between @code{NULL} and non-pointer
types. @option{-Wconversion-null} is enabled by default.

@item -Wctor-dtor-privacy @r{(C++ and Objective-C++ only)}
@opindex Wctor-dtor-privacy
@opindex Wno-ctor-dtor-privacy
Warn when a class seems unusable because all the constructors or
destructors in that class are private, and it has neither friends nor
public static member functions.  Also warn if there are no non-private
methods, and there's at least one private member function that isn't
a constructor or destructor.

@item -Wdelete-non-virtual-dtor @r{(C++ and Objective-C++ only)}
@opindex Wdelete-non-virtual-dtor
@opindex Wno-delete-non-virtual-dtor
Warn when @code{delete} is used to destroy an instance of a class that
has virtual functions and non-virtual destructor. It is unsafe to delete
an instance of a derived class through a pointer to a base class if the
base class does not have a virtual destructor.  This warning is enabled
by @option{-Wall}.

@item -Weffc++ @r{(C++ and Objective-C++ only)}
@opindex Weffc++
@opindex Wno-effc++
Warn about violations of the following style guidelines from Scott Meyers'
@cite{Effective C++} series of books:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Define a copy constructor and an assignment operator for classes
with dynamically-allocated memory.

@item
Prefer initialization to assignment in constructors.

@item
Have @code{operator=} return a reference to @code{*this}.

@item
Don't try to return a reference when you must return an object.

@item
Distinguish between prefix and postfix forms of increment and
decrement operators.

@item
Never overload @code{&&}, @code{||}, or @code{,}.

@end itemize

This option also enables @option{-Wnon-virtual-dtor}, which is also
one of the effective C++ recommendations.  However, the check is
extended to warn about the lack of virtual destructor in accessible
non-polymorphic bases classes too.

When selecting this option, be aware that the standard library
headers do not obey all of these guidelines; use @samp{grep -v}
to filter out those warnings.

@item -Wnarrowing @r{(C++ and Objective-C++ only)}
@opindex Wnarrowing
@opindex Wno-narrowing
Warn when a narrowing conversion prohibited by C++11 occurs within
@samp{@{ @}}, e.g.

@smallexample
int i = @{ 2.2 @}; // error: narrowing from double to int
@end smallexample

This flag is included in @option{-Wall} and @option{-Wc++11-compat}.

With @option{-std=c++11}, @option{-Wno-narrowing} suppresses for
non-constants the diagnostic required by the standard.  Note that this
does not affect the meaning of well-formed code; narrowing conversions
are still considered ill-formed in SFINAE context.

@item -Wnon-virtual-dtor @r{(C++ and Objective-C++ only)}
@opindex Wnon-virtual-dtor
@opindex Wno-non-virtual-dtor
Warn when a class has virtual functions and an accessible non-virtual
destructor itself or in an accessible polymorphic base class, in which
case it is possible but unsafe to delete an instance of a derived
class through a pointer to the class itself or base class.  This
warning is automatically enabled if @option{-Weffc++} is specified.

@item -Wold-style-cast @r{(C++ and Objective-C++ only)}
@opindex Wold-style-cast
@opindex Wno-old-style-cast
Warn if an old-style (C-style) cast to a non-void type is used within
a C++ program.  The new-style casts (@code{dynamic_cast},
@code{static_cast}, @code{reinterpret_cast}, and @code{const_cast}) are
less vulnerable to unintended effects and much easier to search for.

@item -Woverloaded-virtual @r{(C++ and Objective-C++ only)}
@opindex Woverloaded-virtual
@opindex Wno-overloaded-virtual
@cindex overloaded virtual function, warning
@cindex warning for overloaded virtual function
Warn when a function declaration hides virtual functions from a
base class.  For example, in:

@smallexample
struct A @{
  virtual void f();
@};

struct B: public A @{
  void f(int);
@};
@end smallexample

the @code{A} class version of @code{f} is hidden in @code{B}, and code
like:

@smallexample
B* b;
b->f();
@end smallexample

@noindent
fails to compile.

@item -Wreorder @r{(C++ and Objective-C++ only)}
@opindex Wreorder
@opindex Wno-reorder
@cindex reordering, warning
@cindex warning for reordering of member initializers
Warn when the order of member initializers given in the code does not
match the order in which they must be executed.  For instance:

@smallexample
struct A @{
  int i;
  int j;
  A(): j (0), i (1) @{ @}
@};
@end smallexample

@noindent
The compiler rearranges the member initializers for @code{i}
and @code{j} to match the declaration order of the members, emitting
a warning to that effect.  This warning is enabled by @option{-Wall}.

@item -Wsign-promo @r{(C++ and Objective-C++ only)}
@opindex Wsign-promo
@opindex Wno-sign-promo
Warn when overload resolution chooses a promotion from unsigned or
enumerated type to a signed type, over a conversion to an unsigned type of
the same size.  Previous versions of G++ tried to preserve
unsignedness, but the standard mandates the current behavior.

(@emph{Note:} This manual does not describe the Objective-C and Objective-C++
languages themselves.  @xref{Standards,,Language Standards
Supported by LLVM}, for references.)

This section describes the command-line options that are only
meaningful for Objective-C and Objective-C++ programs.  You can also
use most of the language-independent Clang/LLVM compiler options.  For
example, you might compile a file @file{some_class.m} like this:

@smallexample
clang -g -fgnu-runtime -O -c some_class.m
@end smallexample

@noindent
In this example, @option{-fgnu-runtime} is an option meant only for
Objective-C and Objective-C++ programs; you can use the other options with
any language supported by Clang/LLVM@.

Note that since Objective-C is an extension of the C language, Objective-C
compilations may also use options specific to the C front-end (e.g.,
@option{-Wtraditional}).  Similarly, Objective-C++ compilations may use
C++-specific options (e.g., @option{-Wabi}).

@emph{Note:} Not all GCC options are supported by Clang/LLVM.

@end itemize

Here is a list of Clang/LLVM options that are @emph{only} for
compiling Objective-C and Objective-C++ programs:

@table @gcctabopt
@item -fconstant-string-class=@var{class-name}
@opindex fconstant-string-class
Use @var{class-name} as the name of the class to instantiate for each
literal string specified with the syntax @code{@@"@dots{}"}.  The default
class name is @code{NXConstantString} if the GNU runtime is being used, and
@code{NSConstantString} if the NeXT runtime is being used (see below).  The
@option{-fconstant-cfstrings} option, if also present, overrides the
@option{-fconstant-string-class} setting and cause @code{@@"@dots{}"} literals
to be laid out as constant CoreFoundation strings.

@item -fgnu-runtime
@opindex fgnu-runtime
Generate object code compatible with the standard GNU Objective-C
runtime.  This is the default for most types of systems.

@item -fnext-runtime
@opindex fnext-runtime
Generate output compatible with the NeXT runtime.  This is the default
for NeXT-based systems, including Darwin and Mac OS X@.  The macro
@code{__NEXT_RUNTIME__} is predefined if (and only if) this option is
used.

@item -fobjc-abi-version=@var{n}
@opindex fobjc-abi-version
Use version @var{n} of the Objective-C ABI for the selected runtime.
This option is currently supported only for the NeXT runtime.  In that
case, Version 0 is the traditional (32-bit) ABI without support for
properties and other Objective-C 2.0 additions.  Version 1 is the
traditional (32-bit) ABI with support for properties and other
Objective-C 2.0 additions.  Version 2 is the modern (64-bit) ABI.  If
nothing is specified, the default is Version 0 on 32-bit target
machines, and Version 2 on 64-bit target machines.

@item -fobjc-arc
@opindex -fobjc-arc
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -fobjc-arc-exceptions
@opindex -fobjc-arc-exceptions
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -fobjc-call-cxx-cdtors
@opindex fobjc-call-cxx-cdtors
For each Objective-C class, check if any of its instance variables is a
C++ object with a non-trivial default constructor.  If so, synthesize a
special @code{- (id) .cxx_construct} instance method which runs
non-trivial default constructors on any such instance variables, in order,
and then return @code{self}.  Similarly, check if any instance variable
is a C++ object with a non-trivial destructor, and if so, synthesize a
special @code{- (void) .cxx_destruct} method which runs
all such default destructors, in reverse order.

The @code{- (id) .cxx_construct} and @code{- (void) .cxx_destruct}
methods thusly generated only operate on instance variables
declared in the current Objective-C class, and not those inherited
from superclasses.  It is the responsibility of the Objective-C
runtime to invoke all such methods in an object's inheritance
hierarchy.  The @code{- (id) .cxx_construct} methods are invoked
by the runtime immediately after a new object instance is allocated;
the @code{- (void) .cxx_destruct} methods are invoked immediately
before the runtime deallocates an object instance.

As of this writing, only the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.4 and later has
support for invoking the @code{- (id) .cxx_construct} and
@code{- (void) .cxx_destruct} methods.

@item -fobjc-exceptions
@opindex fobjc-exceptions
Enable syntactic support for structured exception handling in
Objective-C, similar to what is offered by C++ and Java.  This option
is required to use the Objective-C keywords @code{@@try},
@code{@@throw}, @code{@@catch}, @code{@@finally} and
@code{@@synchronized}.  This option is available with both the GNU
runtime and the NeXT runtime (but not available in conjunction with
the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.2 and earlier).

@item -fobjc-gc
@opindex fobjc-gc
Enable garbage collection (GC) in Objective-C and Objective-C++
programs.  This option is only available with the NeXT runtime; the
GNU runtime has a different garbage collection implementation that
does not require special compiler flags.

@item -fobjc-gc-only
@opindex -fobjc-gc-only
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@end table

In addition, these optimization, warning, and code generation options
have meanings only for C++ programs:

@table @gcctabopt
@item -Wno-protocol @r{(Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)}
@opindex Wno-protocol
@opindex Wprotocol
If a class is declared to implement a protocol, a warning is issued for
every method in the protocol that is not implemented by the class.  The
default behavior is to issue a warning for every method not explicitly
implemented in the class, even if a method implementation is inherited
from the superclass.  If you use the @option{-Wno-protocol} option, then
methods inherited from the superclass are considered to be implemented,
and no warning is issued for them.

@item -Wselector @r{(Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)}
@opindex Wselector
@opindex Wno-selector
Warn if multiple methods of different types for the same selector are
found during compilation.  The check is performed on the list of methods
in the final stage of compilation.  Additionally, a check is performed
for each selector appearing in a @code{@@selector(@dots{})}
expression, and a corresponding method for that selector has been found
during compilation.  Because these checks scan the method table only at
the end of compilation, these warnings are not produced if the final
stage of compilation is not reached, for example because an error is
found during compilation, or because the @option{-fsyntax-only} option is
being used.

@item -Wstrict-selector-match @r{(Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)}
@opindex Wstrict-selector-match
@opindex Wno-strict-selector-match
Warn if multiple methods with differing argument and/or return types are
found for a given selector when attempting to send a message using this
selector to a receiver of type @code{id} or @code{Class}.  When this flag
is off (which is the default behavior), the compiler omits such warnings
if any differences found are confined to types that share the same size
and alignment.

@item -Wundeclared-selector @r{(Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)}
@opindex Wundeclared-selector
@opindex Wno-undeclared-selector
Warn if a @code{@@selector(@dots{})} expression referring to an
undeclared selector is found.  A selector is considered undeclared if no
method with that name has been declared before the
@code{@@selector(@dots{})} expression, either explicitly in an
@code{@@interface} or @code{@@protocol} declaration, or implicitly in
an @code{@@implementation} section.  This option always performs its
checks as soon as a @code{@@selector(@dots{})} expression is found,
while @option{-Wselector} only performs its checks in the final stage of
compilation.  This also enforces the coding style convention
that methods and selectors must be declared before being used.

Traditionally, diagnostic messages have been formatted irrespective of
the output device's aspect (e.g.@: its width, @dots{}).  You can use the
Clang/LLVM options described below
to control the formatting algorithm for diagnostic messages,
e.g.@: how many characters per line, how often source location
information should be reported.  Note that some language front ends may not
honor these options.

@item -fdiagnostics-color[=@var{WHEN}]
@itemx -fno-diagnostics-color
@opindex fdiagnostics-color
@cindex highlight, color, colour
@vindex GCC_COLORS @r{environment variable}
Use color in diagnostics.  @var{WHEN} is @samp{never}, @samp{always},
or @samp{auto}.  The default depends on how the compiler has been configured,
it can be any of the above @var{WHEN} options or also @samp{never}
if @env{GCC_COLORS} environment variable isn't present in the environment,
and @samp{auto} otherwise.
@samp{auto} means to use color only when the standard error is a terminal.
The forms @option{-fdiagnostics-color} and @option{-fno-diagnostics-color} are
aliases for @option{-fdiagnostics-color=always} and
@option{-fdiagnostics-color=never}, respectively.

The colors are defined by the environment variable @env{GCC_COLORS}.
Its value is a colon-separated list of capabilities and Select Graphic
Rendition (SGR) substrings. SGR commands are interpreted by the
terminal or terminal emulator.  (See the section in the documentation
of your text terminal for permitted values and their meanings as
character attributes.)  These substring values are integers in decimal
representation and can be concatenated with semicolons.
Common values to concatenate include
@samp{1} for bold,
@samp{4} for underline,
@samp{5} for blink,
@samp{7} for inverse,
@samp{39} for default foreground color,
@samp{30} to @samp{37} for foreground colors,
@samp{90} to @samp{97} for 16-color mode foreground colors,
@samp{38;5;0} to @samp{38;5;255}
for 88-color and 256-color modes foreground colors,
@samp{49} for default background color,
@samp{40} to @samp{47} for background colors,
@samp{100} to @samp{107} for 16-color mode background colors,
and @samp{48;5;0} to @samp{48;5;255}
for 88-color and 256-color modes background colors.

The default @env{GCC_COLORS} is
@smallexample
error=01;31:warning=01;35:note=01;36:caret=01;32:locus=01:quote=01
@end smallexample
@noindent
where @samp{01;31} is bold red, @samp{01;35} is bold magenta,
@samp{01;36} is bold cyan, @samp{01;32} is bold green and
@samp{01} is bold. Setting @env{GCC_COLORS} to the empty
string disables colors.
Supported capabilities are as follows.

@table @code
@item error=
@vindex error GCC_COLORS @r{capability}
SGR substring for error: markers.

@item warning=
@vindex warning GCC_COLORS @r{capability}
SGR substring for warning: markers.

@item note=
@vindex note GCC_COLORS @r{capability}
SGR substring for note: markers.

@item caret=
@vindex caret GCC_COLORS @r{capability}
SGR substring for caret line.

@item locus=
@vindex locus GCC_COLORS @r{capability}
SGR substring for location information, @samp{file:line} or
@samp{file:line:column} etc.

@item quote=
@vindex quote GCC_COLORS @r{capability}
SGR substring for information printed within quotes.

@opindex fdiagnostics-print-source-range-info
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -fdiagnostics-show-location=once
@opindex fdiagnostics-show-location
Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic messages
reporter to emit source location information @emph{once}; that is, in
case the message is too long to fit on a single physical line and has to
be wrapped, the source location won't be emitted (as prefix) again,
over and over, in subsequent continuation lines.  This is the default
behavior.

@item -fdiagnostics-show-location=every-line
Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic
messages reporter to emit the same source location information (as
prefix) for physical lines that result from the process of breaking
a message which is too long to fit on a single line.

@item -fdiagnostics-show-note-include-stack
@opindex fdiagnostics-show-note-include-stack
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -fno-diagnostics-show-option
@opindex fno-diagnostics-show-option
@opindex fdiagnostics-show-option
By default, each diagnostic emitted includes text indicating the
command-line option that directly controls the diagnostic (if such an
option is known to the diagnostic machinery).  Specifying the
@option{-fno-diagnostics-show-option} flag suppresses that behavior.

@item -fdiagnostics-show-template-tree

@opindex fmessage-length
Try to format error messages so that they fit on lines of about

done; each error message appears on a single line.  This is the
default for all front ends.

Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions that

@end itemize

The following language-independent options do not enable specific
warnings but control the kinds of diagnostics produced by Clang/LLVM@.

@table @gcctabopt
@cindex syntax checking
@item -fsyntax-only
@opindex fsyntax-only
Check the code for syntax errors, but don't do anything beyond that.

@item -Wpedantic
@itemx -pedantic
@opindex pedantic
@opindex Wpedantic
Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++;
reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other
programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++.  For ISO C, follows the
version of the ISO C standard specified by any @option{-std} option used.

Valid ISO C and ISO C++ programs should compile properly with or without
this option (though a rare few require @option{-ansi} or a
@option{-std} option specifying the required version of ISO C)@.  However,
without this option, certain GNU extensions and traditional C and C++
features are supported as well.  With this option, they are rejected.

@option{-Wpedantic} does not cause warning messages for use of the
alternate keywords whose names begin and end with @samp{__}.  Pedantic
warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
@code{__extension__}.  However, only system header files should use
these escape routes; application programs should avoid them.
@xref{Alternate Keywords}.

Some users try to use @option{-Wpedantic} to check programs for strict ISO
C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they want:
it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all---only those for which
ISO C @emph{requires} a diagnostic, and some others for which
diagnostics have been added.

A feature to report any failure to conform to ISO C might be useful in
some instances, but would require considerable additional work and would
be quite different from @option{-Wpedantic}.  We don't have plans to
support such a feature in the near future.

Where the standard specified with @option{-std} represents a GNU
extended dialect of C, such as @samp{gnu90} or @samp{gnu99}, there is a
corresponding @dfn{base standard}, the version of ISO C on which the GNU
extended dialect is based.  Warnings from @option{-Wpedantic} are given
where they are required by the base standard.  (It does not make sense
for such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified GNU
C dialect, since by definition the GNU dialects of C include all
features the compiler supports with the given option, and there would be
nothing to warn about.)

@item -pedantic-errors
@opindex pedantic-errors
Give an error whenever the @dfn{base standard} (see @option{-Wpedantic})
requires a diagnostic, in some cases where there is undefined behavior
at compile-time and in some other cases that do not prevent compilation
of programs that are valid according to the standard. This is not
equivalent to @option{-Werror=pedantic}, since there are errors enabled
by this option and not enabled by the latter and vice versa.

@item -w
@opindex w
Inhibit all warning messages.

@item -Wall
@opindex Wall
@opindex Wno-all
This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users
consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to
prevent the warning), even in conjunction with macros.  This also
enables some language-specific warnings described in @ref{C++ Dialect
Options} and @ref{Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options}.

@option{-Wall} turns on the following warning flags:

@gccoptlist{-Waddress   @gol
-Warray-bounds=1 @r{(only with} @option{-O2}@r{)}  @gol
-Wc++11-compat  -Wc++14-compat@gol
-Wchar-subscripts  @gol

-Wunused-function  @gol
-Wunused-label     @gol
-Wunused-value     @gol
-Wunused-variable  @gol
-Wvolatile-register-var @gol
}

Note that some warning flags are not implied by @option{-Wall}.  Some of
them warn about constructions that users generally do not consider
questionable, but which occasionally you might wish to check for;
others warn about constructions that are necessary or hard to avoid in
some cases, and there is no simple way to modify the code to suppress
the warning. Some of them are enabled by @option{-Wextra} but many of
them must be enabled individually.

@item -Werror
@opindex Werror
@opindex Wno-error
Make all warnings into errors.

@item -Werror=@var{warning}
@opindex Werror=@var{warning}
@opindex Wno-error=@var{warning}
Make the specified warning into an error.  The specifier for a warning
is appended; for example @option{-Werror=switch} turns the warnings
controlled by @option{-Wswitch} into errors.  This switch takes a
negative form, to be used to negate @option{-Werror} for specific
warnings; for example @option{-Wno-error=switch} makes
@option{-Wswitch} warnings not be errors, even when @option{-Werror}
is in effect.

The warning message for each controllable warning includes the
option that controls the warning.  That option can then be used with
@option{-Werror=} and @option{-Wno-error=} as described above.
(Printing of the option in the warning message can be disabled using the
@option{-fno-diagnostics-show-option} flag.)

Note that specifying @option{-Werror=}@var{foo} automatically implies
@option{-W}@var{foo}.  However, @option{-Wno-error=}@var{foo} does not
imply anything.

@item -Weverything
@opindex Weverything

Enable all warning messages.  In general this is not all that useful,
since some warnings are contradictory.  In particular it is impossible
to write a C++ program that compiles under @option{-Weverything}
without warnings.

@item -Wextra
@opindex W
@opindex Wextra
@opindex Wno-extra
This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by
@option{-Wall}. (This option used to be called @option{-W}.  The older
name is still supported, but the newer name is more descriptive.)

@gccoptlist{-Wclobbered  @gol
-Wempty-body  @gol
-Wignored-qualifiers @gol
-Wmissing-field-initializers  @gol
-Wmissing-parameter-type @r{(C only)}  @gol

-Wunused-but-set-parameter @r{(only with} @option{-Wunused} @r{or} @option{-Wall}@r{)}  @gol
}

The option @option{-Wextra} also prints warning messages for the
following cases:

@itemize @bullet

@item
A pointer is compared against integer zero with @code{<}, @code{<=},
@code{>}, or @code{>=}.

@item
(C++ only) An enumerator and a non-enumerator both appear in a
conditional expression.

@item
(C++ only) Ambiguous virtual bases.

@item
(C++ only) Subscripting an array that has been declared @code{register}.

@item
(C++ only) Taking the address of a variable that has been declared
@code{register}.

@item
(C++ only) A base class is not initialized in a derived class's copy
constructor.

@end itemize

@item -Wfatal-errors
@item -Wno-fatal-errors
@opindex Wfatal-errors
@opindex Wno-fatal-errors
This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the first error
occurred rather than trying to keep going and printing further error
messages.

@end table

You can request many specific warnings with options beginning with
@samp{-W}, for example @option{-Wimplicit} to request warnings on
implicit declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also
has a negative form beginning @samp{-Wno-} to turn off warnings; for
example, @option{-Wno-implicit}.  This manual lists only one of the
two forms, whichever is not the default, although both are listed in
the index.  For further preprocessor-specific options also refer to
@xref{Preprocessor Options}.  For further language-specific options
also refer to @xref{C Dialect Options}, @ref{C++ Dialect Options} and
@ref{Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options}.  For convenience,
options in these sections are cross-referenced from here.

Some options, such as @option{-Wall} and @option{-Wextra}, turn on other
options, such as @option{-Wunused}, which may turn on further options,
such as @option{-Wunused-value}. The combined effect of positive and
negative forms is that more specific options have priority over less
specific ones, independently of their position in the command-line. For
options of the same specificity, the last one takes effect. Options
enabled or disabled via pragmas (@pxref{Diagnostic Pragmas}) take effect
as if they appeared at the end of the command-line.

When an unrecognized warning option is requested (e.g.,
@option{-Wunknown-warning}), Clang/LLVM emits a diagnostic stating
that the option is not recognized.  However, if the @option{-Wno-} form
is used, the behavior is slightly different: no diagnostic is
produced for @option{-Wno-unknown-warning} unless other diagnostics
are being produced.  This allows the use of new @option{-Wno-} options
with old compilers, but if something goes wrong, the compiler
warns that an unrecognized option is present.

@emph{Note:} This behavior differs from GCC, which will silently
accept any options beginning with @option{-Wno-} even if the warning
is unknown.

Warn about suspicious uses of memory addresses. These include using
the address of a function in a conditional expression, such as
@code{void func(void); if (func)}, and comparisons against the memory
address of a string literal, such as @code{if (x == "abc")}.  Such
uses typically indicate a programmer error: the address of a function
always evaluates to true, so their use in a conditional usually
indicate that the programmer forgot the parentheses in a function
call; and comparisons against string literals result in unspecified
behavior and are not portable in C, so they usually indicate that the
programmer intended to use @code{strcmp}.  This warning is enabled by
@option{-Wall}.

changed by the conversion like in @code{abs (2.0)}.  Warnings about
conversions between signed and unsigned integers can be disabled by
using @option{-Wno-sign-conversion}.

For C++, also warn for confusing overload resolution for user-defined
conversions; and conversions that never use a type conversion
operator: conversions to @code{void}, the same type, a base class or a

@item -Wdouble-promotion @r{(C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)}
@opindex Wdouble-promotion
@opindex Wno-double-promotion
Give a warning when a value of type @code{float} is implicitly
promoted to @code{double}.  CPUs with a 32-bit ``single-precision''
floating-point unit implement @code{float} in hardware, but emulate
@code{double} in software.  On such a machine, doing computations
using @code{double} values is much more expensive because of the
overhead required for software emulation.

It is easy to accidentally do computations with @code{double} because
floating-point literals are implicitly of type @code{double}.  For
example, in:
@smallexample
@group
float area(float radius)
@{
   return 3.14159 * radius * radius;
@}
@end group
@end smallexample
the compiler performs the entire computation with @code{double}
because the floating-point literal is a @code{double}.

@option{-Wconversion}.

@item -Wfloat-equal
@opindex Wfloat-equal
@opindex Wno-float-equal
Warn if floating-point values are used in equality comparisons.

The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the
programmer) to consider floating-point values as approximations to
infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing this, then you need
to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or
likely maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it
when performing comparisons (and when producing output, but that's a
different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for equality, you
should check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap; and
this is done with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are
probably mistaken.

@item -Wformat
@itemx -Wformat=0
@itemx -Wformat=1
@opindex Wformat
@opindex Wno-format
@opindex ffreestanding
@opindex fno-builtin
Check calls to @code{printf} and @code{scanf}, etc., to make sure that
the arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string
specified, and that the conversions specified in the format string make
sense.  This includes standard functions, and others specified by format
attributes (@pxref{Function Attributes}), in the @code{printf},
@code{scanf}, @code{strftime} and @code{strfmon} (an X/Open extension,
not in the C standard) families (or other target-specific families).
Which functions are checked without format attributes having been
specified depends on the standard version selected, and such checks of
functions without the attribute specified are disabled by
@option{-ffreestanding} or @option{-fno-builtin}.

The formats are checked against the format features supported by GNU
libc version 2.2.  These include all ISO C90 and C99 features, as well
as features from the Single Unix Specification and some BSD and GNU
extensions.  Other library implementations may not support all these
features; LLVM does not support warning about features that go beyond a
particular library's limitations.  However, if @option{-Wpedantic} is used
with @option{-Wformat}, warnings are given about format features not
in the selected standard version (but not for @code{strfmon} formats,
since those are not in any version of the C standard).  @xref{C Dialect
Options,,Options Controlling C Dialect}.

Option @option{-Wformat} is equivalent to @option{-Wformat=1}, and
@option{-Wno-format} is equivalent to @option{-Wformat=0}.  Since
@option{-Wformat} also checks for null format arguments for several
functions, @option{-Wformat} also implies @option{-Wnonnull}.  Some
aspects of this level of format checking can be disabled by the
options: @option{-Wno-format-contains-nul},
@option{-Wno-format-extra-args}, and @option{-Wno-format-zero-length}.
@option{-Wformat} is enabled by @option{-Wall}.

@item -Wformat=2
@opindex Wformat=2
Enable @option{-Wformat} plus additional format checks.  Currently
equivalent to @option{-Wformat -Wformat-nonliteral -Wformat-security

@item -Wno-format-extra-args
@opindex Wno-format-extra-args
@opindex Wformat-extra-args
If @option{-Wformat} is specified, do not warn about excess arguments to a
@code{printf} or @code{scanf} format function.  The C standard specifies
that such arguments are ignored.

Where the unused arguments lie between used arguments that are
specified with @samp{$} operand number specifications, normally
warnings are still given, since the implementation could not know what
type to pass to @code{va_arg} to skip the unused arguments.  However,
in the case of @code{scanf} formats, this option suppresses the
warning if the unused arguments are all pointers, since the Single
Unix Specification says that such unused arguments are allowed.

@item -Wformat-security
@opindex Wformat-security
@opindex Wno-format-security
If @option{-Wformat} is specified, also warn about uses of format
functions that represent possible security problems.  At present, this
warns about calls to @code{printf} and @code{scanf} functions where the
format string is not a string literal and there are no format arguments,
as in @code{printf (foo);}.  This may be a security hole if the format
string came from untrusted input and contains @samp{%n}.  (This is
currently a subset of what @option{-Wformat-nonliteral} warns about, but
in future warnings may be added to @option{-Wformat-security} that are not
included in @option{-Wformat-nonliteral}.)

@item -Wformat-y2k
@opindex Wformat-y2k
@opindex Wno-format-y2k

@item -Wno-format-zero-length

If @option{-Wformat} is specified, do not warn about zero-length formats.

@item -Wframe-larger-than=@var{len}
@opindex Wframe-larger-than
Warn if the size of a function frame is larger than @var{len} bytes.
The computation done to determine the stack frame size is approximate
and not conservative.
The actual requirements may be somewhat greater than @var{len}
even if you do not get a warning.  In addition, any space allocated
via @code{alloca}, variable-length arrays, or related constructs
is not included by the compiler when determining
whether or not to issue a warning.

@emph{Note:}  It appears that Clang/LLVM may just silently ignore this
option.  Some experimentation for any particular architecture is advised.

ISO C prohibits qualified @code{void} return types on function
definitions, so such return types always receive a warning
even without this option.

This warning is also enabled by @option{-Wextra}.

on by default because the ellipsis is not inherited.

@item -Winit-self @r{(C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)}
@opindex Winit-self
@opindex Wno-init-self
Warn about uninitialized variables that are initialized with themselves.
Note this option can only be used with the @option{-Wuninitialized} option.

For example, LLVM warns about @code{i} being uninitialized in the
following snippet only when @option{-Winit-self} has been specified:
@smallexample
@group
int f()
@{
  int i = i;
  return i;

@item -Winline
@opindex Winline
@opindex Wno-inline
Warn if a function that is declared as inline cannot be inlined.
Even with this option, the compiler does not warn about failures to
inline functions declared in system headers.

The compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not
to inline a function.  For example, the compiler takes into account
the size of the function being inlined and the amount of inlining
that has already been done in the current function.  Therefore,
seemingly insignificant changes in the source program can cause the
warnings produced by @option{-Winline} to appear or disappear.

@item -Wno-int-conversion @r{(C and Objective-C only)}
@opindex Wno-int-conversion

@item -Wno-invalid-offsetof @r{(C++ and Objective-C++ only)}
@opindex Wno-invalid-offsetof
@opindex Winvalid-offsetof
Suppress warnings from applying the @code{offsetof} macro to a non-POD
type.  According to the 2014 ISO C++ standard, applying @code{offsetof}
to a non-standard-layout type is undefined.  In existing C++ implementations,
however, @code{offsetof} typically gives meaningful results.
This flag is for users who are aware that they are
writing nonportable code and who have deliberately chosen to ignore the
warning about it.

The restrictions on @code{offsetof} may be relaxed in a future version
of the C++ standard.

@opindex Wlogical-not-parentheses
@opindex Wno-logical-not-parentheses
Warn about logical not used on the left hand side operand of a comparison.
This option does not warn if the RHS operand is of a boolean type.  Its
purpose is to detect suspicious code like the following:
@smallexample
int a;
@dots{}
if (!a > 1) @{ @dots{} @}
@end smallexample

It is possible to suppress the warning by wrapping the LHS into
parentheses:
@smallexample

Warn if an aggregate or union initializer is not fully bracketed.  In
the following example, the initializer for @code{a} is not fully
bracketed, but that for @code{b} is fully bracketed.  This warning is
enabled by @option{-Wall} in C.

@smallexample
int a[2][2] = @{ 0, 1, 2, 3 @};

@item -Wmissing-field-initializers
@opindex Wmissing-field-initializers
@opindex Wno-missing-field-initializers
@opindex W
@opindex Wextra
@opindex Wno-extra
Warn if a structure's initializer has some fields missing.  For
example, the following code causes such a warning, because
@code{x.h} is implicitly zero:

@smallexample
struct s @{ int f, g, h; @};
struct s x = @{ 3, 4 @};
@end smallexample

This option does not warn about designated initializers, so the following
modification does not trigger a warning:

@smallexample
struct s @{ int f, g, h; @};
struct s x = @{ .f = 3, .g = 4 @};
@end smallexample

In C++ this option does not warn either about the empty @{ @}
initializer, for example:

@smallexample
struct s @{ int f, g, h; @};
s x = @{ @};
@end smallexample

This warning is included in @option{-Wextra}.  To get other @option{-Wextra}
warnings without this one, use @option{-Wextra -Wno-missing-field-initializers}.

@item -Wmissing-format-attribute
@opindex Wmissing-format-attribute
@opindex Wno-missing-format-attribute

Warn about function pointers that might be candidates for
@code{format} attributes.  Note these are only possible candidates,
not absolute ones.  GCC guesses that function pointers with
@code{format} attributes that are used in assignment, initialization,
parameter passing or return statements should have a corresponding
@code{format} attribute in the resulting type.  I.e.@: the left-hand
side of the assignment or initialization, the type of the parameter
variable, or the return type of the containing function respectively
should also have a @code{format} attribute to avoid the warning.

GCC also warns about function definitions that might be candidates for
@code{format} attributes.  Again, these are only possible candidates.
GCC guesses that @code{format} attributes might be appropriate for any
function that calls a function like @code{vprintf} or @code{vscanf},
but this might not always be the case, and some functions for which
@code{format} attributes are appropriate may not be detected.

@item -Woverlength-strings
@opindex Woverlength-strings
@opindex Wno-overlength-strings
Warn about string constants that are longer than the ``minimum
maximum'' length specified in the C standard.  Modern compilers
generally allow string constants that are much longer than the
standard's minimum limit, but very portable programs should avoid
using longer strings.

The limit applies @emph{after} string constant concatenation, and does
not count the trailing NUL@.  In C90, the limit was 509 characters; in
C99, it was raised to 4095.  C++98 does not specify a normative
minimum maximum, so we do not diagnose overlength strings in C++@.

This option is implied by @option{-Wpedantic}, and can be disabled with
@option{-Wno-overlength-strings}.

@item -Wpacked
@opindex Wpacked
@opindex Wno-packed
Warn if a structure is given the packed attribute, but the packed
attribute has no effect on the layout or size of the structure.
Such structures may be mis-aligned for little benefit.  For
instance, in this code, the variable @code{f.x} in @code{struct bar}
is misaligned even though @code{struct bar} does not itself
have the packed attribute:

@smallexample
@group
struct foo @{
  int x;
  char a, b, c, d;
@} __attribute__((packed));
struct bar @{
  char z;
  struct foo f;
@};
@end group
@end smallexample

@item -Wpadded
@opindex Wpadded
@opindex Wno-padded
Warn if padding is included in a structure, either to align an element
of the structure or to align the whole structure.  Sometimes when this
happens it is possible to rearrange the fields of the structure to
reduce the padding and so make the structure smaller.

@item -Wparentheses
@opindex Wparentheses
@opindex Wno-parentheses
Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such
as when there is an assignment in a context where a truth value
is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
often get confused about.

Also warn if a comparison like @code{x<=y<=z} appears; this is
equivalent to @code{(x<=y ? 1 : 0) <= z}, which is a different
interpretation from that of ordinary mathematical notation.

Also warn about constructions where there may be confusion to which
@code{if} statement an @code{else} branch belongs.  Here is an example of
such a case:

@smallexample
@group
@{
  if (a)
    if (b)
      foo ();
  else
    bar ();
@}
@end group
@end smallexample

In C/C++, every @code{else} branch belongs to the innermost possible
@code{if} statement, which in this example is @code{if (b)}.  This is
often not what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above
example by indentation the programmer chose.  When there is the
potential for this confusion, LLVM issues a warning when this flag
is specified.  To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around
the innermost @code{if} statement so there is no way the @code{else}
can belong to the enclosing @code{if}.  The resulting code
looks like this:

@smallexample
@group
@{
  if (a)
    @{
      if (b)
        foo ();
      else
        bar ();
    @}
@}
@end group
@end smallexample

Also warn for dangerous uses of the GNU extension to
@code{?:} with omitted middle operand. When the condition
in the @code{?}: operator is a boolean expression, the omitted value is
always 1.  Often programmers expect it to be a value computed
inside the conditional expression instead.

This warning is enabled by @option{-Wall}.

@item -Wparentheses-equality

@item -Wpointer-arith

convenience in calculations with @code{void *} pointers and pointers
to functions.  In C++, warn also when an arithmetic operation involves
@code{NULL}.  This warning is also enabled by @option{-Wpedantic}.

Warn whenever a function is defined with a return type that defaults
to @code{int}.  Also warn about any @code{return} statement with no
return value in a function whose return type is not @code{void}
(falling off the end of the function body is considered returning
without a value), and about a @code{return} statement with an
expression in a function whose return type is @code{void}.

For C++, a function without return type always produces a diagnostic
message, even when @option{-Wno-return-type} is specified.  The only
exceptions are @code{main} and functions defined in system headers.

@item -Wsequence-point
@opindex Wsequence-point
@opindex Wno-sequence-point
Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of violations
of sequence point rules in the C and C++ standards.

The C and C++ standards define the order in which expressions in a C/C++
program are evaluated in terms of @dfn{sequence points}, which represent
a partial ordering between the execution of parts of the program: those
executed before the sequence point, and those executed after it.  These
occur after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part
of a larger expression), after the evaluation of the first operand of a
@code{&&}, @code{||}, @code{? :} or @code{,} (comma) operator, before a
function is called (but after the evaluation of its arguments and the
expression denoting the called function), and in certain other places.
Other than as expressed by the sequence point rules, the order of
evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All
these rules describe only a partial order rather than a total order,
since, for example, if two functions are called within one expression
with no sequence point between them, the order in which the functions
are called is not specified.  However, the standards committee have
ruled that function calls do not overlap.

It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the
values of objects take effect.  Programs whose behavior depends on this
have undefined behavior; the C and C++ standards specify that ``Between
the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored
value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.
Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine the value
to be stored.''.  If a program breaks these rules, the results on any
particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.

Examples of code with undefined behavior are @code{a = a++;}, @code{a[n]
= b[n++]} and @code{a[i++] = i;}.  Some more complicated cases are not
diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false positive
result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at detecting
this sort of problem in programs.

The standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate
over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle cases.
Links to discussions of the problem, including proposed formal
definitions, may be found on the GCC readings page, at
@uref{http://gcc.gnu.org/@/readings.html}.

@opindex Wno-shadow
Warn whenever a local variable or type declaration shadows another
variable, parameter, type, class member (in C++), or instance variable
(in Objective-C) or whenever a built-in function is shadowed. Note
that in C++, the compiler warns if a local variable shadows an
explicit typedef, but not if it shadows a struct/class/enum.

Warn when a comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce
an incorrect result when the signed value is converted to unsigned.
This warning is also enabled by @option{-Wextra}; to get the other warnings
of @option{-Wextra} without this warning, use
@option{-Wextra -Wno-sign-compare}.

@item -Wsign-conversion
@opindex Wsign-conversion
@opindex Wno-sign-conversion
Warn for implicit conversions that may change the sign of an integer
value, like assigning a signed integer expression to an unsigned
integer variable. An explicit cast silences the warning. In C, this
option is enabled also by @option{-Wconversion}.

@item -Wsizeof-array-argument
@opindex Wsizeof-array-argument

@item -Wstrict-aliasing
@opindex Wstrict-aliasing
@opindex Wno-strict-aliasing
This option is only active when @option{-fstrict-aliasing} is active.
It warns about code that might break the strict aliasing rules that the
compiler is using for optimization.  The warning does not catch all
cases, but does attempt to catch the more common pitfalls.  It is
included in @option{-Wall}.
It is equivalent to @option{-Wstrict-aliasing=3}

@item -Wstrict-aliasing=n
@opindex Wstrict-aliasing
This option is only active when @option{-fstrict-aliasing} is active.
It warns about code that might break the strict aliasing rules that the
compiler is using for optimization.
Higher levels correspond to higher accuracy (fewer false positives).
Higher levels also correspond to more effort, similar to the way @option{-O}
works.
@option{-Wstrict-aliasing} is equivalent to @option{-Wstrict-aliasing=3}.

Level 1: Most aggressive, quick, least accurate.
Possibly useful when higher levels
do not warn but @option{-fstrict-aliasing} still breaks the code, as it has very few
false negatives.  However, it has many false positives.
Warns for all pointer conversions between possibly incompatible types,
even if never dereferenced.  Runs in the front end only.

Level 2: Aggressive, quick, not too precise (default for
@option{-Wstrict-aliasing}).  May still have many false positives (not
as many as level 1 though), and few false negatives (but possibly more
than level 1).  Unlike level 1, it only warns when an address is
taken.  Warns about incomplete types.  Runs in the front end only.

@emph{Note:} GCC has Level 3, which is the default, but no such level
is supported by Clang/LLVM.

@item -Wstrict-overflow
@itemx -Wstrict-overflow=@var{n}
@opindex Wstrict-overflow
@opindex Wno-strict-overflow
This option is only active when @option{-fstrict-overflow} is active.
It warns about cases where the compiler optimizes based on the
assumption that signed overflow does not occur.  Note that it does not
warn about all cases where the code might overflow: it only warns
about cases where the compiler implements some optimization.  Thus
this warning depends on the optimization level.

An optimization that assumes that signed overflow does not occur is
perfectly safe if the values of the variables involved are such that
overflow never does, in fact, occur.  Therefore this warning can
easily give a false positive: a warning about code that is not
actually a problem.  To help focus on important issues, several
warning levels are defined.  No warnings are issued for the use of
undefined signed overflow when estimating how many iterations a loop
requires, in particular when determining whether a loop will be
executed at all.

@table @gcctabopt
@item -Wstrict-overflow=1
Warn about cases that are both questionable and easy to avoid.  For
example,  with @option{-fstrict-overflow}, the compiler simplifies
@code{x + 1 > x} to @code{1}.  This level of
@option{-Wstrict-overflow} is enabled by @option{-Wall}; higher levels
are not, and must be explicitly requested.

@item -Wstrict-overflow=2
Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified to a
constant.  For example: @code{abs (x) >= 0}.  This can only be
simplified when @option{-fstrict-overflow} is in effect, because
@code{abs (INT_MIN)} overflows to @code{INT_MIN}, which is less than
zero.  @option{-Wstrict-overflow} (with no level) is the same as
@option{-Wstrict-overflow=2}.

@item -Wstrict-overflow=3
Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified.  For
example: @code{x + 1 > 1} is simplified to @code{x > 0}.

@item -Wstrict-overflow=4
Also warn about other simplifications not covered by the above cases.
For example: @code{(x * 10) / 5} is simplified to @code{x * 2}.

@item -Wstrict-overflow=5
Also warn about cases where the compiler reduces the magnitude of a
constant involved in a comparison.  For example: @code{x + 2 > y} is
simplified to @code{x + 1 >= y}.  This is reported only at the
highest warning level because this simplification applies to many
comparisons, so this warning level gives a very large number of
false positives.

@item -Wswitch
@opindex Wswitch
@opindex Wno-switch
Warn whenever a @code{switch} statement has an index of enumerated type
and lacks a @code{case} for one or more of the named codes of that
enumeration.  (The presence of a @code{default} label prevents this
warning.)  @code{case} labels outside the enumeration range also
provoke warnings when this option is used (even if there is a
@code{default} label).
This warning is enabled by @option{-Wall}.

@item -Wswitch-bool
@opindex Wswitch-bool
@opindex Wno-switch-bool
Warn whenever a @code{switch} statement has an index of boolean type
and the case values are outside the range of a boolean type.
It is possible to suppress this warning by casting the controlling
expression to a type other than @code{bool}.  For example:
@smallexample
@group
switch ((int) (a == 4))
  @{
  @dots{}
  @}
@end group
@end smallexample
This warning is enabled by default for C and C++ programs.

@opindex Wno-switch-enum
Warn whenever a @code{switch} statement has an index of enumerated type
and lacks a @code{case} for one or more of the named codes of that
enumeration.  @code{case} labels outside the enumeration range also
provoke warnings when this option is used.  The only difference
between @option{-Wswitch} and this option is that this option gives a
warning about an omitted enumeration code even if there is a
@code{default} label.

@item -Wsystem-headers

@cindex system headers, warnings from
Print warning messages for constructs found in system header files.
Warnings from system headers are normally suppressed, on the assumption
that they usually do not indicate real problems and would only make the
compiler output harder to read.  Using this command-line option tells
Clang/LLVM to emit warnings from system headers as if they occurred in user
code.  However, note that using @option{-Wall} in conjunction with this
option does @emph{not} warn about unknown pragmas in system
headers---for that, @option{-Wunknown-pragmas} must also be used.

@item -Wtautological-compare

@item -Wuninitialized

@opindex Wno-uninitialized
Warn if an automatic variable is used without first being initialized
or if a variable may be clobbered by a @code{setjmp} call. In C++,
warn if a non-static reference or non-static @code{const} member
appears in a class without constructors.

If you want to warn about code that uses the uninitialized value of the
variable in its own initializer, use the @option{-Winit-self} option.

These warnings occur for individual uninitialized or clobbered
elements of structure, union or array variables as well as for
variables that are uninitialized or clobbered as a whole.  They do
not occur for variables or elements declared @code{volatile}.  Because
these warnings depend on optimization, the exact variables or elements
for which there are warnings depends on the precise optimization
options and version of LLVM used.

Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used only
to compute a value that itself is never used, because such
computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the warnings
are printed.

@item -Wunused-value
@opindex Wunused-value
@opindex Wno-unused-value
Warn whenever a statement computes a result that is explicitly not
used. To suppress this warning cast the unused expression to
@code{void}. This includes an expression-statement or the left-hand
side of a comma expression that contains no side effects. For example,
an expression such as @code{x[i,j]} causes a warning, while
@code{x[(void)i,j]} does not.

This warning is enabled by @option{-Wall}.

@item -Wunused-variable
@opindex Wunused-variable

@opindex Wno-write-strings
When compiling C, give string constants the type @code{const
char[@var{length}]} so that copying the address of one into a
non-@code{const} @code{char *} pointer produces a warning.  These
warnings help you find at compile time code that can try to write
into a string constant, but only if you have been very careful about
using @code{const} in declarations and prototypes.  Otherwise, it is
just a nuisance. This is why we did not make @option{-Wall} request
these warnings.

When compiling C++, warn about the deprecated conversion from string
literals to @code{char *}.  This warning is enabled by default for C++
programs.

@item -Wzero-length-array

@end table

The following Clang/LLVM warnings are specific to C and Objective-C.

@table @gcctabopt
@item -Wbad-function-cast @r{(C and Objective-C only)}
@opindex Wbad-function-cast
@opindex Wno-bad-function-cast
Warn when a function call is cast to a non-matching type.
For example, warn if a call to a function returning an integer type
is cast to a pointer type.

@item -Wdeclaration-after-statement @r{(C and Objective-C only)}
@opindex Wdeclaration-after-statement
@opindex Wno-declaration-after-statement
Warn when a declaration is found after a statement in a block.  This
construct, known from C++, was introduced with ISO C99 and is by default
allowed in LLVM@.  It is not supported by ISO C90.  @xref{Mixed Declarations}.

@item -Wmissing-declarations @r{(C, C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++ only)}
@opindex Wmissing-declarations
@opindex Wno-missing-declarations
Warn if a global function is defined without a previous declaration.
Do so even if the definition itself provides a prototype.
Use this option to detect global functions that are not declared in
header files.  In C, no warnings are issued for functions with previous
non-prototype declarations; use @option{-Wmissing-prototypes} to detect
missing prototypes.  In C++, no warnings are issued for function templates,
or for inline functions, or for functions in anonymous namespaces.

@item -Wmissing-prototypes @r{(C and Objective-C only)}
@opindex Wmissing-prototypes
@opindex Wno-missing-prototypes
Warn if a global function is defined without a previous prototype
declaration.  This warning is issued even if the definition itself
provides a prototype.  Use this option to detect global functions
that do not have a matching prototype declaration in a header file.
This option is not valid for C++ because all function declarations
provide prototypes and a non-matching declaration declares an
overload rather than conflict with an earlier declaration.
Use @option{-Wmissing-declarations} to detect missing declarations in C++.

@item -Wnested-externs @r{(C and Objective-C only)}

@opindex Wno-nested-externs
Warn if an @code{extern} declaration is encountered within a function.

@item -Wold-style-definition @r{(C and Objective-C only)}
@opindex Wold-style-definition
@opindex Wno-old-style-definition
Warn if an old-style function definition is used.  A warning is given
even if there is a previous prototype.

@item -Wpointer-sign @r{(C and Objective-C only)}
@opindex Wpointer-sign
@opindex Wno-pointer-sign
Warn for pointer argument passing or assignment with different signedness.
This option is only supported for C and Objective-C@.  It is implied by
@option{-Wall} and by @option{-Wpedantic}, which can be disabled with
@option{-Wno-pointer-sign}.

@item -Wstrict-prototypes @r{(C and Objective-C only)}
@opindex Wstrict-prototypes
@opindex Wno-strict-prototypes
Warn if a function is declared or defined without specifying the
argument types.  (An old-style function definition is permitted without
a warning if preceded by a declaration that specifies the argument
types.)

@node Debugging Options
@section Options for Debugging Your Program
@cindex options, debugging
@cindex debugging information options

To tell Clang/LLVM to emit extra information for use by a debugger, in almost
all cases you need only to add @option{-g} to your other options.

Clang/LLVM allows you to use @option{-g} with
@option{-O}.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
be surprising: some variables you declared may not exist
at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it;
some statements may not be executed because they compute constant
results or their values are already at hand; some statements may
execute in different places because they have been moved out of loops.
Nevertheless it is possible to debug optimized output.  This makes
it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.

Unlike GCC, Clang/LLVM does not offer @option{-Og}, which is used to
get a better debugging experience by running compiler passes that
collect information useful for debugging, even when no other
@option{-O} option is specified.

@emph{Note:} Not all GCC options are supported by Clang/LLVM.
@xref{Option Summary,,Option Summary}, for details of:
@itemize @bullet
@item
those options supported by both Clang/LLVM and GCC;
@item
those options only supported by Clang/LLVM; and
@item
those options supported only by GCC.
@end itemize

The following Clang/LLVM options assist in debugging.

@table @gcctabopt
@item -fdebug-prefix-map=@var{old}=@var{new}
@opindex fdebug-prefix-map
When compiling files in directory @file{@var{old}}, record debugging
information describing them as in @file{@var{new}} instead.

@item -fdebug-types-section
@opindex fdebug-types-section
@opindex fno-debug-types-section
When using DWARF Version 4 or higher, type DIEs can be put into
their own @code{.debug_types} section instead of making them part of the
@code{.debug_info} section.  It is more efficient to put them in a separate
comdat sections since the linker can then remove duplicates.
But not all DWARF consumers support @code{.debug_types} sections yet
and on some objects @code{.debug_types} produces larger instead of smaller
debugging information.

@item -fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm
@opindex fdwarf2-cfi-asm
@opindex fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm
Emit DWARF 2 unwind info as compiler generated @code{.eh_frame} section
instead of using GAS @code{.cfi_*} directives.

@item -fno-eliminate-unused-debug-types
@opindex feliminate-unused-debug-types
@opindex fno-eliminate-unused-debug-types
Normally, when producing DWARF 2 output, LLVM avoids producing debug symbol
output for types that are nowhere used in the source file being compiled.
Sometimes it is useful to have LLVM emit debugging
information for all types declared in a compilation
unit, regardless of whether or not they are actually used
in that compilation unit, for example
if, in the debugger, you want to cast a value to a type that is
not actually used in your program (but is declared).  More often,
however, this results in a significant amount of wasted space.

@item -fstandalone-debug
@opindex fstandalone-debug
@opindex fno-standalone-debug
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -g@r{[}@var{level}@r{]}
@opindex g
@opindex ggdb
Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format,
which is always DWARF for Clang/LLVM.  LLDB or GDB can work with this
debugging information.

Clang/LLVM allows you to use @option{-g} with optimization options
@option{-O@var{n}}.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
produce surprising results: some variables you declared may not exist
at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it;
some statements may not be executed because they compute constant
results or their values are already at hand; some statements may
execute in different places because they have been moved out of loops.

Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output.  This makes
it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.

Option @option{-g} allows specification of a @var{level} to specify
how much information should be produced.  The default level is 2.  The
following options are useful for fine-grain control over the debugging
output.

Level 0 produces no debug information at all.  Thus, @option{-g0} negates
@option{-g}.

Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in
parts of the program that you don't plan to debug.  This includes
descriptions of functions and external variables, and line number
tables, but no information about local variables.

Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions
present in the program.  Some debuggers support macro expansion when
you use @option{-g3}.

@item -gcodeview
@opindex gcodeview
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -gdwarf-@var{version}
@opindex gdwarf-@var{version}
Produce debugging information in DWARF format (if that is supported).
The value of @var{version} may be either 2, 3, 4 or 5; the default version
for Clang/LLVM is 4.  Version 4 may require GDB 7.0 or later for
maximum benefit.

@item -gfull
@opindex gfull
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -ggdb@r{[}@var{level}@r{]}
@opindex ggdb
Produce debugging information for use by GDB@.  This means to use the
most expressive format available (DWARF 4), including GDB extensions
if at all possible.  The optional @var{level} has the same meaning as
wiht @option{-g}.

@item -ggnu-pubnames
@opindex ggnu-pubnames
Generate .debug_pubnames and .debug_pubtypes sections in a format
suitable for conversion into a GDB@ index.  This option is only useful
with a linker that can produce GDB@ index version 7.

@item -gline-tables-only
@opindex gline-tables-only
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -gmodules
@opindex gmodules
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -gno-record-gcc-switches
@opindex gno-record-gcc-switches
Disallow appending command-line options to the DW_AT_producer attribute
in DWARF debugging information.

@item -grecord-gcc-switches
@opindex grecord-gcc-switches
This switch causes the command-line options used to invoke the
compiler that may affect code generation to be appended to the
DW_AT_producer attribute in DWARF debugging information.  The options
are concatenated with spaces separating them from each other and from
the compiler version.  See also @option{-frecord-gcc-switches} for another
way of storing compiler options into the object file.  This is the default.

@item -gsplit-dwarf
@opindex gsplit-dwarf
Separate as much dwarf debugging information as possible into a
separate output file with the extension .dwo.  This option allows
the build system to avoid linking files with debug information.  To
be useful, this option requires a debugger capable of reading .dwo
files.

@item -gstrict-dwarf
@opindex gstrict-dwarf
Disallow using extensions of later DWARF standard version than selected
with @option{-gdwarf-@var{version}}.  On most targets using non-conflicting
DWARF extensions from later standard versions is allowed.

@item -gno-strict-dwarf
@opindex gno-strict-dwarf
Allow using extensions of later DWARF standard version than selected with
@option{-gdwarf-@var{version}}.

@item -gused
@opindex gused
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@node Optimize Options
@section Options That Control Optimization
@cindex optimize options
@cindex options, optimization

These options control various sorts of optimizations.

Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce the
cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected
results.  Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any
variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the
function and get exactly the results you expect from the source
code.

Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve
the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time
and possibly the ability to debug the program.

The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has of the
program.  Compiling multiple files at once to a single output file mode allows
the compiler to use information gained from all of the files when compiling
each of them.

Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only
optimizations that have a flag are listed in this section.

Most optimizations are only enabled if an @option{-O} level is set on
the command line.  Otherwise they are disabled, even if individual
optimization flags are specified.

Depending on the target and how Clang/LLVM was configured, a slightly different
set of optimizations may be enabled at each @option{-O} level than
those listed here.  You can invoke Clang/LLVM with @option{-Q --help=optimizers}
to find out the exact set of optimizations that are enabled at each level.
@xref{Overall Options}, for examples.

@emph{Note:} Not all GCC options are supported by Clang/LLVM.
@xref{Option Summary,,Option Summary}, for details of:
@itemize @bullet
@item
those options supported by both Clang/LLVM and GCC;
@item
those options only supported by Clang/LLVM; and
@item
those options supported only by GCC.
@end itemize

The following Clang/LLVM options control optimization.

@table @gcctabopt
@item -fassociative-math
@opindex fassociative-math

Allow re-association of operands in series of floating-point operations.
This violates the ISO C and C++ language standard by possibly changing
computation result.  NOTE: re-ordering may change the sign of zero as
well as ignore NaNs and inhibit or create underflow or overflow (and
thus cannot be used on code that relies on rounding behavior like
@code{(x + 2**52) - 2**52}.  May also reorder floating-point comparisons
and thus may not be used when ordered comparisons are required.
This option requires that both @option{-fno-signed-zeros} and
@option{-fno-trapping-math} be in effect.  Moreover, it doesn't make
much sense with @option{-frounding-math}. For Fortran the option
is automatically enabled when both @option{-fno-signed-zeros} and
@option{-fno-trapping-math} are in effect.

The default is @option{-fno-associative-math}.

@item -fdata-sections
@itemx -ffunction-sections
@opindex fdata-sections
@opindex ffunction-sections
Place each function or data item into its own section in the output
file if the target supports arbitrary sections.  The name of the
function or the name of the data item determines the section's name
in the output file.

Use these options on systems where the linker can perform optimizations
to improve locality of reference in the instruction space.  Most systems
using the ELF object format and SPARC processors running Solaris 2 have
linkers with such optimizations.  AIX may have these optimizations in
the future.

Only use these options when there are significant benefits from doing
so.  When you specify these options, the assembler and linker
create larger object and executable files and are also slower.
You cannot use @command{gprof} on all systems if you
specify this option, and you may have problems with debugging if
you specify both this option and @option{-g}.

@item -ffast-math
@opindex ffast-math
Sets the options @option{-fno-math-errno}, @option{-funsafe-math-optimizations},
@option{-ffinite-math-only}, @option{-fno-rounding-math},
@option{-fno-signaling-nans} and @option{-fcx-limited-range}.

This option causes the preprocessor macro @code{__FAST_MATH__} to be defined.

This option is not turned on by any @option{-O} option besides
@option{-Ofast} since it can result in incorrect output for programs
that depend on an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications
for math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs
that do not require the guarantees of these specifications.

@item -ffinite-math-only
@opindex ffinite-math-only
Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that assume
that arguments and results are not NaNs or +-Infs.

This option is not turned on by any @option{-O} option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs that depend on
an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for
math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs
that do not require the guarantees of these specifications.

The default is @option{-fno-finite-math-only}.

@item -ffp-contract=@var{style}
@opindex ffp-contract
@option{-ffp-contract=off} disables floating-point expression contraction.
@option{-ffp-contract=fast} enables floating-point expression contraction
such as forming of fused multiply-add operations if the target has
native support for them.
@option{-ffp-contract=on} enables floating-point expression contraction
if allowed by the language standard.  This is currently not implemented
and treated equal to @option{-ffp-contract=off}.

The default is @option{-ffp-contract=fast}.

@item -fno-inline
@opindex fno-inline
Do not expand any functions inline apart from those marked with
the @code{always_inline} attribute.  This is the default when not
optimizing.

Single functions can be exempted from inlining by marking them
with the @code{noinline} attribute.

@item -flto@r{[}=full@r{|}thin@r{]}
@opindex flto
This option runs the standard link-time optimizer.  When invoked with
source code, it generates LLVM IR and writes it as bytecode to the
object files (which are thus not ELF files).  When the object files
are linked together, all the function bodies are read from these ELF
sections and instantiated as if they had been part of the same
translation unit.

@emph{Note:} LTO will only work if you use a linker with plugin support.

To use the link-time optimizer, @option{-flto} and optimization
options should be specified at compile time and during the final link.
For example:

@smallexample
clang -c -O2 -flto foo.c
clang -c -O2 -flto bar.c
clang -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.o bar.o
@end smallexample

The first two invocations to LLVM save a bytecode representation of IR
into @file{foo.o} and @file{bar.o}.  The final invocation reads the IR
from @file{foo.o} and @file{bar.o}, merges the two files into a single
internal image, and compiles the result as usual.  Since both
@file{foo.o} and @file{bar.o} are merged into a single image, this
causes all the interprocedural analyses and optimizations in
Clang/LLVM to work across the two files as if they were a single one.
This means, for example, that the inliner is able to inline functions
in @file{bar.o} into functions in @file{foo.o} and vice-versa.

Another (simpler) way to enable link-time optimization is:

@smallexample
clang -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.c bar.c
@end smallexample

The above generates bytecode for @file{foo.c} and @file{bar.c},
merges them together into a single IR representation and optimizes
them as usual to produce @file{myprog}.

The only important thing to keep in mind is that to enable link-time
optimizations you need to use the Clang/LLVM driver to perform the link-step.
Clang/LLVM then automatically performs link-time optimization if any of the
objects involved were compiled with the @option{-flto}.  You generally
should specify the optimization options to be used for link-time
optimization though LLVM tries to be clever at guessing an
optimization level to use from the options used at compile-time
if you fail to specify one at link-time.

Unlike GCC, the generated @file{.o} files only contain LLVM IR
bytecode, not the ELF object code.  So you cannot override the
automatic decision to do link-time optimization at link-time by
passing @option{-fno-lto} to the link command.

To make whole program optimization effective, it is necessary to make
certain whole program assumptions.  The compiler needs to know
what functions and variables can be accessed by libraries and runtime
outside of the link-time optimized unit.  The linkder passes information
to the compiler about used and externally visible symbols.

Additionally, the optimization flags used to compile individual files
are not necessarily related to those used at link time.  For instance,

@smallexample
clang -c -O0 -ffat-lto-objects -flto foo.c
clang -c -O0 -ffat-lto-objects -flto bar.c
clang -o myprog -O3 foo.o bar.o
@end smallexample

This produces individual object files with unoptimized LLVM IR
bytecode but the resulting binary @file{myprog} is optimized at
@option{-O3}.

When producing the final binary, Clang/LLVM only applies link-time
optimizations to those files that contain bytecode.  Therefore, you
can mix and match object files and libraries with LLVM IR bytecodes
and final object code.  Clang/LLVM automatically selects which files
to optimize in LTO mode and which files to link without further
processing.

There are some code generation flags preserved by LLVM when
generating bytecodes, as they need to be used during the final link
stage.  Generally options specified at link-time override those
specified at compile-time.

If you do not specify an optimization level option @option{-O} at
link-time then LLVM computes one based on the optimization levels
used when compiling the object files.  The highest optimization
level wins here.

Currently, the following options and their setting are taken from the
first object file that explicitely specified it: @option{-fPIC},
@option{-fpic}, @option{-fpie}, @option{-fcommon},
@option{-fexceptions}, @option{-fnon-call-exceptions} and all the
@option{-m} target flags.

In general ABI changing flags are required to match in all compilation-units
and trying to override this at link-time with a conflicting value
is ignored.

Other options such as @option{-ffp-contract}, @option{-fno-strict-overflow},
@option{-fwrapv}, @option{-fno-trapv} or @option{-fno-strict-aliasing}
are passed through to the link stage and merged conservatively for
conflicting translation units.  Specifically
@option{-fno-strict-overflow}, @option{-fwrapv} and @option{-fno-trapv} take
precedence and for example @option{-ffp-contract=off} takes precedence
over @option{-ffp-contract=fast}.  You can override them at linke-time.

It is recommended that you compile all the files participating in the
same link with the same options and also specify those options at
link time.

If LTO encounters objects with C linkage declared with incompatible
types in separate translation units to be linked together (undefined
behavior according to ISO C99 6.2.7), a non-fatal diagnostic may be
issued.  The behavior is still undefined at run time.  Similar
diagnostics may be raised for other languages.

Another feature of LTO is that it is possible to apply interprocedural
optimizations on files written in different languages:

@smallexample
clang -c -flto foo.c
clang++ -c -flto bar.cc
clang++ -o myprog -flto -O3 foo.o bar.o
@end smallexample

Notice that the final link is done with @command{g++} to get the C++
runtime libraries.  In general, when mixing languages in LTO mode, you
should use the same link command options as when mixing languages in a
regular (non-LTO) compilation.

If object files containing LLVM IR bytecode are stored in a library archive, say
@file{libfoo.a}, it is possible to extract and use them in an LTO link.  To create static libraries suitable
for LTO, you will need versions of @command{ar} and @command{ranlib}
with support for plugins and need to pass them the LTO plugin DLL via
the @option{-plugin} option.  Similarly to show the symbols of object
files with LLVM IR bytecode, you will need @command{nm} compiled with
plugin support and the @option{-plugin} option.

The current implementation of LTO makes no
attempt to generate bytecode that is portable between different
types of hosts.  The bytecode files are versioned and there is a
strict version check, so bytecode files generated in one version of
LLVM do not work with an older or newer version of LLVM.

Link-time optimization does not work well with generation of debugging
information.  Combining @option{-flto} with @option{-g} is currently
experimental and likely to produce unexpected results.

The @option{-flto} option can be qualified with @option{=full} or
@option{=thin} to control how LTO is run.  Plain @option{-flto} is the
same as @option{-flto=full}.  Teresa Johnson and Xinlian David Li at
Google have implemented an alternative approach, which should be
faster and more parallel for large programs, which is enabled using
@option{-flto=full}.  See
@uref{http://llvm.org/devmtg/2015-04/slides/ThinLTO_EuroLLVM2015.pdf,
``A Fine-Grained Demand-Driven Infrastructure, EuroLLVM 2015}.

The GCC qualifiers @option{-flto=@var{n}} and @option{-flto=jobserver}
are not supported by Clang/LLVM.

@item -fno-math-errno
@opindex fno-math-errno
Do not set @code{errno} after calling math functions that are executed
with a single instruction, e.g., @code{sqrt}.  A program that relies on
IEEE exceptions for math error handling may want to use this flag
for speed while maintaining IEEE arithmetic compatibility.

This option is not turned on by any @option{-O} option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs that depend on
an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for
math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs
that do not require the guarantees of these specifications.

The default is @option{-fmath-errno}.

On Darwin systems, the math library never sets @code{errno}.  There is
therefore no reason for the compiler to consider the possibility that
it might, and @option{-fno-math-errno} is the default.

@item -fmerge-all-constants
@opindex fmerge-all-constants
Attempt to merge identical constants and identical variables.

This option implies @option{-fmerge-constants}.  In addition to
@option{-fmerge-constants} this considers e.g.@: even constant initialized
arrays or initialized constant variables with integral or floating-point
types.  Languages like C or C++ require each variable, including multiple
instances of the same variable in recursive calls, to have distinct locations,
so using this option results in non-conforming
behavior.

@item -fomit-frame-pointer
@opindex fomit-frame-pointer
Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for functions that
don't need one.  This avoids the instructions to save, set up and
restore frame pointers; it also makes an extra register available
in many functions.  @strong{It also makes debugging impossible on
some machines.}

On some machines, such as the VAX, this flag has no effect, because
the standard calling sequence automatically handles the frame pointer
and nothing is saved by pretending it doesn't exist.  The
machine-description macro @code{FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED} controls
whether a target machine supports this flag.  @xref{Registers,,Register
Usage, gccint, GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) Internals}.

The default setting (when not optimizing for
size) for 32-bit GNU/Linux x86 and 32-bit Darwin x86 targets is
@option{-fomit-frame-pointer}.  You can configure LLVM with the
@option{--enable-frame-pointer} configure option to change the default.

Enabled at levels @option{-O}, @option{-O2}, @option{-O3}, @option{-Os}.

@item -foptimize-sibling-calls
@opindex foptimize-sibling-calls
Optimize sibling and tail recursive calls.

Enabled at levels @option{-O2}, @option{-O3}, @option{-Os}.

@item -fprofile-use
@itemx -fprofile-use=@var{path}
@opindex fprofile-use
Enable profile feedback-directed optimizations.  Unlike GCC, in
Clang/LLVM the individual profiling optimizations which are triggered
by @option{-fprofile-use} are not directly available to the user, so
not listed here.  They can be accessed directly in the underlying
@command{opt} and @command{llc} components using the @option{-mllvm}
option (@pxref{op mllvm},,@option{-mllvm}).

By default, Clang/LLVM emits an error message if the feedback profiles do not
match the source code.

If @var{path} is specified, LLVM looks at the @var{path} to find
the profile feedback data files.

@item -freciprocal-math
@opindex freciprocal-math
@opindex fno-reciprocal-math
Allow the reciprocal of a value to be used instead of dividing by
the value if this enables optimizations.  For example @code{x / y}
can be replaced with @code{x * (1/y)}, which is useful if @code{(1/y)}
is subject to common subexpression elimination.  Note that this loses
precision and increases the number of flops operating on the value.

The default is @option{-fno-reciprocal-math}.

@item -freroll-loops
@opindex freroll-loops
@opindex fno-reroll-loops
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -fno-signed-zeros
@opindex fsigned-zeros
@opindex fno-signed-zeros
Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that ignore the
signedness of zero.  IEEE arithmetic specifies the behavior of
distinct +0.0 and @minus{}0.0 values, which then prohibits simplification
of expressions such as x+0.0 or 0.0*x (even with @option{-ffinite-math-only}).
This option implies that the sign of a zero result isn't significant.

The default is @option{-fsigned-zeros}.

@item -fslp-vectorize-aggressive
@opindex fslp-vectorize-aggressive
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -fslp-vectorize
@opindex fslp-vectorize
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -fstrict-aliasing
@opindex fstrict-aliasing
Allow the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules applicable to
the language being compiled.  For C (and C++), this activates
optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In particular, an
object of one type is assumed never to reside at the same address as an
object of a different type, unless the types are almost the same.  For
example, an @code{unsigned int} can alias an @code{int}, but not a
@code{void*} or a @code{double}.  A character type may alias any other
type.

@anchor{Type-punning}Pay special attention to code like this:
@smallexample
union a_union @{
  int i;
  double d;
@};

int f() @{
  union a_union t;
  t.d = 3.0;
  return t.i;
@}
@end smallexample
The practice of reading from a different union member than the one most
recently written to (called ``type-punning'') is common.  Even with
@option{-fstrict-aliasing}, type-punning is allowed, provided the memory
is accessed through the union type.  So, the code above works as
expected.  @xref{Structures unions enumerations and bit-fields
implementation}.  However, this code might not:
@smallexample
int f() @{
  union a_union t;
  int* ip;
  t.d = 3.0;
  ip = &t.i;
  return *ip;
@}
@end smallexample

Similarly, access by taking the address, casting the resulting pointer
and dereferencing the result has undefined behavior, even if the cast
uses a union type, e.g.:
@smallexample
int f() @{
  double d = 3.0;
  return ((union a_union *) &d)->i;
@}
@end smallexample

The @option{-fstrict-aliasing} option is enabled at levels
@option{-O2}, @option{-O3}, @option{-Os}.

@item -fstrict-enums
@opindex fstrict-enums
Allow the compiler to optimize using the assumption that a value of
enumerated type can only be one of the values of the enumeration (as
defined in the C++ standard; basically, a value that can be
represented in the minimum number of bits needed to represent all the
enumerators).  This assumption may not be valid if the program uses a
cast to convert an arbitrary integer value to the enumerated type.

@item -fstrict-overflow
@opindex fstrict-overflow
Allow the compiler to assume strict signed overflow rules, depending
on the language being compiled.  For C (and C++) this means that
overflow when doing arithmetic with signed numbers is undefined, which
means that the compiler may assume that it does not happen.  This
permits various optimizations.  For example, the compiler assumes
that an expression like @code{i + 10 > i} is always true for
signed @code{i}.  This assumption is only valid if signed overflow is
undefined, as the expression is false if @code{i + 10} overflows when
using twos complement arithmetic.  When this option is in effect any
attempt to determine whether an operation on signed numbers
overflows must be written carefully to not actually involve overflow.

This option also allows the compiler to assume strict pointer
semantics: given a pointer to an object, if adding an offset to that
pointer does not produce a pointer to the same object, the addition is
undefined.  This permits the compiler to conclude that @code{p + u >
p} is always true for a pointer @code{p} and unsigned integer
@code{u}.  This assumption is only valid because pointer wraparound is
undefined, as the expression is false if @code{p + u} overflows using
twos complement arithmetic.

See also the @option{-fwrapv} option.  Using @option{-fwrapv} means
that integer signed overflow is fully defined: it wraps.  When
@option{-fwrapv} is used, there is no difference between
@option{-fstrict-overflow} and @option{-fno-strict-overflow} for
integers.  With @option{-fwrapv} certain types of overflow are
permitted.  For example, if the compiler gets an overflow when doing
arithmetic on constants, the overflowed value can still be used with
@option{-fwrapv}, but not otherwise.

The @option{-fstrict-overflow} option is enabled at levels
@option{-O2}, @option{-O3}, @option{-Os}.

@opindex fthinlto-index=@var{file}
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -fno-trapping-math
@opindex fno-trapping-math
Compile code assuming that floating-point operations cannot generate
user-visible traps.  These traps include division by zero, overflow,
underflow, inexact result and invalid operation.  This option requires
that @option{-fno-signaling-nans} be in effect.  Setting this option may
allow faster code if one relies on ``non-stop'' IEEE arithmetic, for example.

This option should never be turned on by any @option{-O} option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs that depend on
an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for
math functions.

The default is @option{-ftrapping-math}.

@item -ftree-slp-vectorize
@opindex ftree-slp-vectorize
Perform basic block vectorization on trees. This flag is enabled by default at
@option{-O3} and when @option{-ftree-vectorize} is enabled.

@item -funit-at-a-time
@opindex funit-at-a-time
This option is left for compatibility reasons. @option{-funit-at-a-time}
has no effect, while @option{-fno-unit-at-a-time} implies
@option{-fno-toplevel-reorder} and @option{-fno-section-anchors}.

Enabled by default.

@item -ftree-vectorize
@opindex ftree-vectorize
Perform vectorization on trees. This flag enables @option{-ftree-loop-vectorize}
and @option{-ftree-slp-vectorize} if not explicitly specified.

@item -funroll-loops
@opindex funroll-loops
Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile time or
upon entry to the loop.  @option{-funroll-loops} implies
@option{-frerun-cse-after-loop}, @option{-fweb} and @option{-frename-registers}.
It also turns on complete loop peeling (i.e.@: complete removal of loops with
a small constant number of iterations).  This option makes code larger, and may
or may not make it run faster.

Enabled with @option{-fprofile-use}.

@item -funsafe-math-optimizations
@opindex funsafe-math-optimizations
@opindex fno-unsafe-math-optimizations
Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that (a) assume
that arguments and results are valid and (b) may violate IEEE or
ANSI standards.  When used at link-time, it may include libraries
or startup files that change the default FPU control word or other
similar optimizations.

This option is not turned on by any @option{-O} option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs that depend on
an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for
math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs
that do not require the guarantees of these specifications.
Enables @option{-fno-signed-zeros}, @option{-fno-trapping-math},
@option{-fassociative-math} and @option{-freciprocal-math}.

The default is @option{-fno-unsafe-math-optimizations}.

@item -fvectorize
@opindex fvectorize
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -fno-zero-initialized-in-bss
@opindex fzero-initialized-in-bss
@opindex fno-zero-initialized-in-bss
If the target supports a BSS section, LLVM by default puts variables that
are initialized to zero into BSS@.  This can save space in the resulting
code.

This option turns off this behavior because some programs explicitly
rely on variables going to the data section---e.g., so that the
resulting executable can find the beginning of that section and/or make
assumptions based on that.

The default is @option{-fzero-initialized-in-bss}.

@item -mllvm @var{option}
@anchor{op mllvm}
@opindex mllvm @var{option}
Pass @var{option} to the internal clang command line parser.  This
allows access to a number of more advanced options.  Unlike the
standard options, there is no guarantee of stability in these options.

Details of these options will be included in a future version of this
documentation.  The list of options can be seen by running
@smallexample
clang -cc1 -help
@end smallexample

@item -mrelax-all
@opindex mrelax-all
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -O0
@opindex O0
Reduce compilation time and make debugging produce the expected
results.  This is the default.

@item -O
@itemx -O1
@opindex O
@opindex O1
Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot
more memory for a large function.

With @option{-O}, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
time, without performing any optimizations that take a great deal of
compilation time.

Because of the way Clang/LLVM works, it is not easy to list the
individual optimization passes turned on by @option{-O}.

@option{-O} turns on @option{-fomit-frame-pointer} on machines
where doing so does not interfere with debugging.

@item -O2
@opindex O2
Optimize even more.  LLVM performs nearly all supported optimizations
that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.
As compared to @option{-O}, this option increases both compilation time
and the performance of the generated code.

@emph{Note:} When compiling a program using computed gotos, a GCC
extension, compile time performance may be very severly degraded.
This is caused by the global common sub-expression elimination
optimization, and at present there is no mechanism to disable this
optimization pass in Clang/LLVM.

@item -O3
@opindex O3
Optimize yet more.  @option{-O3} turns on all optimizations specified
by @option{-O2} and then some more.

@item -O4
@opindex O4
This option is now deprecated in Clang/LLVM, and treated as equivalent
to @option{-O3}.

@item -Ofast
@opindex Ofast
Disregard strict standards compliance.  @option{-Ofast} enables all
@option{-O3} optimizations.  It also enables optimizations that are not
valid for all standard-compliant programs.
It turns on @option{-ffast-math}.

@item -Os
@opindex Os
Optimize for size.  @option{-Os} enables all @option{-O2} optimizations that
do not typically increase code size.  It also performs further
optimizations designed to reduce code size.

@item -Oz
@opindex Oz
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item --param @var{name}=@var{value}
@opindex param
In some places, Clang/LLVM uses various constants to control the amount of
optimization that is done.  For example, Clang/LLVM does not inline functions
that contain more than a certain number of instructions.  You can
adjust many of these by using the @option{-mllvm} option to set
advanced options.

The @option{--param} option is the GCC equivalent of this. While in
general this option is not available in Clang/LLVM, one option,
@option{--param ssp-buffer-size=@var{n}} is supported.

This sets the minimum size of buffers (i.e.@: arrays) that receive
stack smashing protection when stack protection (option
@option{-fstack-protector}) is used.

@cindex options, program instrumentation

GCC supports a number of command-line options that control adding
run-time instrumentation to the code it normally generates.
For example, one purpose of instrumentation is collect profiling
statistics for use in finding program hot spots, code coverage
analysis, or profile-guided optimizations.
Another class of program instrumentation is adding run-time checking
to detect programming errors like invalid pointer
dereferences or out-of-bounds array accesses, as well as deliberately
hostile attacks such as stack smashing or C++ vtable hijacking.
There is also a general hook which can be used to implement other
forms of tracing or function-level instrumentation for debug or
program analysis purposes.

@emph{Note:} Not all GCC options are supported by Clang/LLVM.

@end itemize

The following Clang/LLVM options facilitate program instrumentation.

@table @gcctabopt

@item --analyze
@opindex -analyze
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@cindex @command{gcov}
@item --coverage
@opindex coverage

This option is used to compile and link code instrumented for coverage
analysis.  The option is a synonym for @option{-fprofile-arcs}
@option{-ftest-coverage} (when compiling) and @option{-lgcov} (when
linking).  See the documentation for those options for more details.

@itemize

@item
Compile the source files with @option{-fprofile-arcs} plus optimization
and code generation options.  For test coverage analysis, use the
additional @option{-ftest-coverage} option.  You do not need to profile
every source file in a program.

@item
Link your object files with @option{-lgcov} or @option{-fprofile-arcs}
(the latter implies the former).

@item
Run the program on a representative workload to generate the arc profile
information.  This may be repeated any number of times.  You can run
concurrent instances of your program, and provided that the file system
supports locking, the data files will be correctly updated.  Also
@code{fork} calls are detected and correctly handled (double counting
will not happen).

@item
For profile-directed optimizations, compile the source files again with
the same optimization and code generation options plus
@option{-fbranch-probabilities} (@pxref{Optimize Options,,Options that
Control Optimization}).

@item
For test coverage analysis, use @command{gcov} to produce human readable
information from the @file{.gcno} and @file{.gcda} files.  Refer to the
@command{gcov} documentation for further information.

@end itemize

With @option{-fprofile-arcs}, for each function of your program LLVM
creates a program flow graph, then finds a spanning tree for the graph.
Only arcs that are not on the spanning tree have to be instrumented: the
compiler adds code to count the number of times that these arcs are
executed.  When an arc is the only exit or only entrance to a block, the
instrumentation code can be added to the block; otherwise, a new basic
block must be created to hold the instrumentation code.

@item -fcoverage-mapping
@opindex fcoverage-mapping
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -finstrument-functions
@opindex finstrument-functions
Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to functions.  Just
after function entry and just before function exit, the following
profiling functions are called with the address of the current
function and its call site.  (On some platforms,
@code{__builtin_return_address} does not work beyond the current
function, so the call site information may not be available to the
profiling functions otherwise.)

@smallexample
void __cyg_profile_func_enter (void *this_fn,
                               void *call_site);
void __cyg_profile_func_exit  (void *this_fn,
                               void *call_site);
@end smallexample

The first argument is the address of the start of the current function,
which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table.

This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded inline in other
functions.  The profiling calls indicate where, conceptually, the
inline function is entered and exited.  This means that addressable
versions of such functions must be available.  If all your uses of a
function are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion of
code size.  If you use @code{extern inline} in your C code, an
addressable version of such functions must be provided.  (This is
normally the case anyway, but if you get lucky and the optimizer always
expands the functions inline, you might have gotten away without
providing static copies.)

A function may be given the attribute @code{no_instrument_function}, in
which case this instrumentation is not done.  This can be used, for
example, for the profiling functions listed above, high-priority
interrupt routines, and any functions from which the profiling functions
cannot safely be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the profiling
routines generate output or allocate memory).

@item -fprofile-arcs
@opindex fprofile-arcs
Add code so that program flow @dfn{arcs} are instrumented.  During
execution the program records how many times each branch and call is
executed and how many times it is taken or returns.  When the compiled
program exits it saves this data to a file called
@file{@var{auxname}.gcda} for each source file.  The data may be used for
profile-directed optimizations (@option{-fbranch-probabilities}), or for
test coverage analysis (@option{-ftest-coverage}).  Each object file's
@var{auxname} is generated from the name of the output file, if
explicitly specified and it is not the final executable, otherwise it is
the basename of the source file.  In both cases any suffix is removed
(e.g.@: @file{foo.gcda} for input file @file{dir/foo.c}, or
@file{dir/foo.gcda} for output file specified as @option{-o dir/foo.o}).

@item -fprofile-generate
@itemx -fprofile-generate=@var{path}
@opindex fprofile-generate

Enable options usually used for instrumenting application to produce
profile useful for later recompilation with profile feedback based
optimization.  You must use @option{-fprofile-generate} both when
compiling and when linking your program.

The following option is enabled: @option{-fprofile-arcs}.

If @var{path} is specified, Clang/LLVM looks at the @var{path} to store
the profile feedback data files.

@item -fprofile-instr-generate@r{[}=@var{file}@r{]}
@opindex fprofile-instr-generate@r{[}=@var{file}@r{]}
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -fprofile-instr-use@r{[}=@var{file}@r{]}
@opindex fprofile-instr-use@r{[}=@var{file}@r{]}
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -fprofile-sample-use=@var{file}
@opindex fprofile-sample-use=@var{file}
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -fno-sanitize=all
@opindex fno-sanitize=all
This option disables all previously enabled sanitizers.
@option{-fsanitize=all} is not allowed, as some sanitizers cannot be used
together.

@item -fsanitize=address
@opindex fsanitize=address
Enable AddressSanitizer, a fast memory error detector.
Memory access instructions are instrumented to detect
out-of-bounds and use-after-free bugs.
See @uref{http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/} for
more details.  The run-time behavior can be influenced using the
@env{ASAN_OPTIONS} environment variable; see
@url{https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/Flags#Run-time_flags} for
a list of supported options.

@item -fsanitize=alignment
@opindex fsanitize=alignment
This option enables checking of alignment of pointers when they are
dereferenced, or when a reference is bound to insufficiently aligned target,
or when a method or constructor is invoked on insufficiently aligned object.

This is a sub-option of the UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (@pxref{op
fsanitize=undefined,,@option{-fsanitize=undefined}}).

@item -fsanitize=bool
@opindex fsanitize=bool
This option enables instrumentation of loads from bool.  If a value other
than 0/1 is loaded, a run-time error is issued.

This is a sub-option of the UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (@pxref{op
fsanitize=undefined,,@option{-fsanitize=undefined}}).

@item -fsanitize=bounds
@opindex fsanitize=bounds
This option enables instrumentation of array bounds.  Various out of bounds
accesses are detected.  Flexible array members, flexible array member-like
arrays, and initializers of variables with static storage are not instrumented.

This is a sub-option of the UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (@pxref{op
fsanitize=undefined,,@option{-fsanitize=undefined}}).

@item -fsanitize=cfi
@opindex fsanitize=cfi
Clang/LLVM option for future documentation.

@item -fsanitize=enum
@opindex fsanitize=enum
This option enables instrumentation of loads from an enum type.  If
a value outside the range of values for the enum type is loaded,
a run-time error is issued.

This is a sub-option of the UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (@pxref{op
fsanitize=undefined,,@option{-fsanitize=undefined}}).

@item -fsanitize=float-cast-overflow
@opindex fsanitize=float-cast-overflow
This option enables floating-point type to integer conversion checking.
We check that the result of the conversion does not overflow.
Unlike other similar options, @option{-fsanitize=float-cast-overflow} is
not enabled by @option{-fsanitize=undefined}.
This option does not work well with @code{FE_INVALID} exceptions enabled.

This is a sub-option of the UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (@pxref{op
fsanitize=undefined,,@option{-fsanitize=undefined}}).

@item -fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero
@opindex fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero
Detect floating-point division by zero.  Unlike other similar options,
@option{-fsanitize=float-divide-by-zero} is not enabled by
@option{-fsanitize=undefined}, since floating-point division by zero can
be a legitimate way of obtaining infinities and NaNs.

This is a sub-option of the UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (@pxref{op
fsanitize=undefined,,@option{-fsanitize=undefined}}).

@item -fsanitize=integer-divide-by-zero
@opindex fsanitize=integer-divide-by-zero
Detect integer division by zero as well as @code{INT_MIN / -1} division.

This is a sub-option of the UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (@pxref{op
fsanitize=undefined,,@option{-fsanitize=undefined}}).

@item -fsanitize=kernel-address
@opindex fsanitize=kernel-address
Enable AddressSanitizer for Linux kernel.
See @uref{https://github.com/google/kasan/wiki} for more details.

@item -fsanitize=leak
@opindex fsanitize=leak
Enable LeakSanitizer, a memory leak detector.
This option only matters for linking of executables and if neither
@option{-fsanitize=address} nor @option{-fsanitize=thread} is used.  In that
case the executable is linked against a library that overrides @code{malloc}
and other allocator functions.  See
@uref{https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/LeakSanitizer} for more
details.  The run-time behavior can be influenced using the
@env{LSAN_OPTIONS} environment variable.

@item -fsanitize=nonnull-attribute
@opindex fsanitize=nonnull-attribute

This option enables instrumentation of calls, checking whether null values
are not passed to arguments marked as requiring a non-null value by the
@code{nonnull} function attribute.

This is a sub-option of the UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (@pxref{op
fsanitize=undefined,,@option{-fsanitize=undefined}}).

@item -fsanitize=null
@opindex fsanitize=null
This option enables pointer checking.  Particularly, the application
built with this option turned on will issue an error message when it
tries to dereference a NULL pointer, or if a reference (possibly an
rvalue reference) is bound to a NULL pointer, or if a method is invoked
on an object pointed by a NULL pointer.

This is a sub-option of the UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (@pxref{op
fsanitize=undefined,,@option{-fsanitize=undefined}}).

@item -fsanitize=object-size
@opindex fsanitize=object-size
This option enables instrumentation of memory references using the
@code{__builtin_object_size} function.  Various out of bounds pointer
accesses are detected.

This is a sub-option of the UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (@pxref{op
fsanitize=undefined,,@option{-fsanitize=undefined}}).

@item -fsanitize=return
@opindex fsanitize=return
This option enables return statement checking.  Programs
built with this option turned on will issue an error message
when the end of a non-void function is reached without actually
returning a value.  This option works in C++ only.

This is a sub-option of the UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (@pxref{op
fsanitize=undefined,,@option{-fsanitize=undefined}}).

@item -fsanitize=returns-nonnull-attribute
@opindex fsanitize=returns-nonnull-attribute

This option enables instrumentation of return statements in functions
marked with @code{returns_nonnull} function attribute, to detect returning
of null values from such functions.

This is a sub-option of the UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (@pxref{op
fsanitize=undefined,,@option{-fsanitize=undefined}}).

@item -fsanitize=shift
@opindex fsanitize=shift
This option enables checking that the result of a shift operation is
not undefined.  Note that what exactly is considered undefined differs
slightly between C and C++, as well as between ISO C90 and C99, etc.

This is a sub-option of the UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (@pxref{op
fsanitize=undefined,,@option{-fsanitize=undefined}}).

@item -fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow
@opindex fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow
This option enables signed integer overflow checking.  We check that
the result of @code{+}, @code{*}, and both unary and binary @code{-}
does not overflow in the signed arithmetics.  Note, integer promotion
rules must be taken into account.  That is, the following is not an
overflow:
@smallexample
signed char a = SCHAR_MAX;
a++;
@end smallexample

This is a sub-option of the UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (@pxref{op
fsanitize=undefined,,@option{-fsanitize=undefined}}).

@item -fsanitize=thread
@opindex fsanitize=thread
Enable ThreadSanitizer, a fast data race detector.  Memory access
instructions are instrumented to detect data race bugs.  See
@uref{https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki#threadsanitizer} for
more details. The run-time behavior can be influenced using the
@env{TSAN_OPTIONS} environment variable; see
@url{https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/ThreadSanitizerFlags}
for a list of supported options.

@anchor{op fsanitize=undefined}
@item -fsanitize=undefined

While @option{-ftrapv} causes traps for signed overflows to be emitted,
@option{-fsanitize=undefined} gives a diagnostic message.
This currently works only for the C family of languages.

@item -fsanitize=unreachable
@opindex fsanitize=unreachable
With this option, the compiler turns the @code{__builtin_unreachable}
call into a diagnostics message call instead.  When reaching the
@code{__builtin_unreachable} call, the behavior is undefined.

This is a sub-option of the UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (@pxref{op
fsanitize=undefined,,@option{-fsanitize=undefined}}).

@item -fsanitize=vla-bound
@opindex fsanitize=vla-bound
This option instructs the compiler to check that the size of a variable
length array is positive.

This is a sub-option of the UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (@pxref{op
fsanitize=undefined,,@option{-fsanitize=undefined}}).

@item -fsanitize=vptr
@opindex fsanitize=vptr

This option enables instrumentation of C++ member function calls, member
accesses and some conversions between pointers to base and derived classes,
to verify the referenced object has the correct dynamic type.

This is a sub-option of the UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (@pxref{op
fsanitize=undefined,,@option{-fsanitize=undefined}}).

@item -fsanitize-recover@r{[}=@var{opts}@r{]}
@opindex fsanitize-recover
@opindex fno-sanitize-recover
@option{-fsanitize-recover=} controls error recovery mode for sanitizers
mentioned in comma-separated list of @var{opts}.  Enabling this option
for a sanitizer component causes it to attempt to continue
running the program as if no error happened.  This means multiple
runtime errors can be reported in a single program run, and the exit
code of the program may indicate success even when errors
have been reported.  The @option{-fno-sanitize-recover=} option
can be used to alter
this behavior: only the first detected error is reported
and program then exits with a non-zero exit code.

Currently this feature only works for:

The @option{-fsanitize-undefined-trap-on-error} option instructs the compiler to
report undefined behavior using @code{__builtin_trap} rather than
a @code{libubsan} library routine.  The advantage of this is that the
@code{libubsan} library is not needed and is not linked in, so this
is usable even in freestanding environments.

@item -fsplit-stack
@opindex fsplit-stack
Generate code to automatically split the stack before it overflows.
The resulting program has a discontiguous stack which can only
overflow if the program is unable to allocate any more memory.  This
is most useful when running threaded programs, as it is no longer
necessary to calculate a good stack size to use for each thread.  This
is currently only implemented for the x86 targets running
GNU/Linux.

When code compiled with @option{-fsplit-stack} calls code compiled
without @option{-fsplit-stack}, there may not be much stack space
available for the latter code to run.  If compiling all code,
including library code, with @option{-fsplit-stack} is not an option,
then the linker can fix up these calls so that the code compiled
without @option{-fsplit-stack} always has a large stack.  Support for
this is implemented in the gold linker in GNU binutils release 2.21
and later.

@item -fstack-check
@opindex fstack-check
Generate code to verify that you do not go beyond the boundary of the
stack.  You should specify this flag if you are running in an
environment with multiple threads, but you only rarely need to specify it in
a single-threaded environment since stack overflow is automatically
detected on nearly all systems if there is only one stack.

Note that this switch does not actually cause checking to be done; the
operating system or the language runtime must do that.  The switch causes
generation of code to ensure that they see the stack being extended.

You can additionally specify a string parameter: @samp{no} means no
checking, @samp{generic} means force the use of old-style checking,
@samp{specific} means use the best checking method and is equivalent
to bare @option{-fstack-check}.

Old-style checking is a generic mechanism that requires no specific
target support in the compiler but comes with the following drawbacks:

@enumerate
@item
Modified allocation strategy for large objects: they are always
allocated dynamically if their size exceeds a fixed threshold.

@item
Fixed limit on the size of the static frame of functions: when it is
topped by a particular function, stack checking is not reliable and
a warning is issued by the compiler.

@item
Inefficiency: because of both the modified allocation strategy and the
generic implementation, code performance is hampered.
@end enumerate

Note that old-style stack checking is also the fallback method for
@samp{specific} if no target support has been added in the compiler.

@item -fstack-protector
@opindex fstack-protector
Emit extra code to check for buffer overflows, such as stack smashing
attacks.  This is done by adding a guard variable to functions with
vulnerable objects.  This includes functions that call @code{alloca}, and
functions with buffers larger than 8 bytes.  The guards are initialized
when a function is entered and then checked when the function exits.
If a guard check fails, an error message is printed and the program exits.

@item -fstack-protector-all
@opindex fstack-protector-all
Like @option{-fstack-protector} except that all functions are protected.

@item -fstack-protector-strong
@opindex fstack-protector-strong
Like @option{-fstack-protector} but includes additional functions to
be protected --- those that have local array definitions, or have
references to local frame addresses.

@need 2000
@item -ftest-coverage
@opindex ftest-coverage
Produce a notes file that the @command{gcov} code-coverage utility can
use to show program coverage.  Each source file's note file is called
@file{@var{auxname}.gcno}.  Refer to the @option{-fprofile-arcs}
option above for a description of @var{auxname} and instructions on
how to generate test coverage data.  Coverage data matches the source
files more closely if you do not optimize.

@cindex @command{gprof}
@item -pg
@opindex pg
Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
analysis program @command{gprof}.  You must use this option when compiling
the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
linking.

@end table

@node Preprocessor Options
@section Options Controlling the Preprocessor
@cindex preprocessor options
@cindex options, preprocessor

@emph{Note:} Not all GCC options are supported by Clang/LLVM.
@xref{Option Summary,,Option Summary}, for details of:
@itemize @bullet
@item
those options supported by both Clang/LLVM and GCC;
@item
those options only supported by Clang/LLVM; and
@item
those options supported only by GCC.
@end itemize

These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C source
file before actual compilation.

If you use the @option{-E} option, nothing is done except preprocessing.
Some of these options make sense only together with @option{-E} because
they cause the preprocessor output to be unsuitable for actual
compilation.

The following options have LLVM behavior which differs from GCC:
@gccoptlist{-C}

The following GCC options are accepted by LLVM, but have no effect and
by default will generate a warning:
@gccoptlist{-A@var{question}=@var{answer} @gol
-A-@var{question}@r{[}=@var{answer}@r{]}}

The following GCC options are not accepted by LLVM:
@gccoptlist{-A@var{question}=@var{answer} @gol
-A-@var{question}@r{[}=@var{answer}@r{]} @gol
-C  -dD  -dI  -dM  -dN -dU @gol

-remap -trigraphs  -undef  -U@var{macro}  @gol
-Wp,@var{option} -Xpreprocessor @var{option} -no-integrated-cpp}

@table @gcctabopt
@item -Wp,@var{option}
@opindex Wp
You can use @option{-Wp,@var{option}} to bypass the compiler driver
and pass @var{option} directly through to the preprocessor.  If
@var{option} contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the
commas.  However, many options are modified, translated or interpreted
by the compiler driver before being passed to the preprocessor, and
@option{-Wp} forcibly bypasses this phase.  The preprocessor's direct
interface is undocumented and subject to change, so whenever possible
you should avoid using @option{-Wp} and let the driver handle the
options instead.

@item -Xpreprocessor @var{option}
@opindex Xpreprocessor
Pass @var{option} as an option to the preprocessor.  You can use this to
supply system-specific preprocessor options that LLVM does not
recognize.

If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
@option{-Xpreprocessor} twice, once for the option and once for the argument.

@item -no-integrated-cpp
@opindex no-integrated-cpp
Perform preprocessing as a separate pass before compilation.  By
default, LLVM performs preprocessing as an integrated part of input
tokenization and parsing.  If this option is provided, @command{clang}
is instead invoked twice, once for preprocessing only and once for
actual compilation of the preprocessed input.  This option may be
useful in conjunction with the @option{-B} or @option{-wrapper}
options to specify an alternate preprocessor or perform additional
processing of the program source between normal preprocessing and
compilation.

@item -D @var{name}
@opindex D
Predefine @var{name} as a macro, with definition @code{1}.

@item -D @var{name}=@var{definition}
The contents of @var{definition} are tokenized and processed as if
they appeared during translation phase three in a @samp{#define}
directive.  In particular, the definition will be truncated by
embedded newline characters.

If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like
program you may need to use the shell's quoting syntax to protect
characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.

If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command line, write
its argument list with surrounding parentheses before the equals sign
(if any).  Parentheses are meaningful to most shells, so you will need
to quote the option.  With @command{sh} and @command{csh},
@option{-D'@var{name}(@var{args@dots{}})=@var{definition}'} works.

@option{-D} and @option{-U} options are processed in the order they
are given on the command line.  All @option{-imacros @var{file}} and
@option{-include @var{file}} options are processed after all
@option{-D} and @option{-U} options.

@item -U @var{name}
@opindex U
Cancel any previous definition of @var{name}, either built in or
provided with a @option{-D} option.

@item -undef
@opindex undef
Do not predefine any system-specific or LLVM-specific macros.  The
standard predefined macros remain defined.

@item -I @var{dir}
@opindex I
Add the directory @var{dir} to the list of directories to be searched
for header files.  Directories named by @option{-I} are searched
before the standard system include directories.  If the directory
@var{dir} is a standard system include directory, the option is
ignored to ensure that the default search order for system directories
and the special treatment of system headers are not defeated.  If
@var{dir} begins with @code{=}, then the @code{=} will be replaced by
the sysroot prefix; see @option{--sysroot} and @option{-isysroot}.

@item -Wundef
@opindex Wundef
@opindex Wno-undef
@xref{op Wundef,,@option{-Wundef}}

@item -Wunused-macros
@opindex Wunused-macros
Warn about macros defined in the main file that are unused.  A macro
is @dfn{used} if it is expanded or tested for existence at least once.
The preprocessor will also warn if the macro has not been used at the
time it is redefined or undefined.

Built-in macros, macros defined on the command line, and macros
defined in include files are not warned about.

@emph{Note:} If a macro is actually used, but only used in skipped
conditional blocks, then CPP will report it as unused.  To avoid the
warning in such a case, you might improve the scope of the macro's
definition by, for example, moving it into the first skipped block.
Alternatively, you could provide a dummy use with something like:

@smallexample
#if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning
#endif
@end smallexample

@item -Wendif-labels
@anchor{op Wno-endif-labels}
@opindex Wno-endif-labels
@opindex Wendif-labels
Warn whenever an @samp{#else} or an @samp{#endif} is followed by text.
This usually happens in code of the form:

@smallexample
#if FOO
@dots{}
#else FOO
@dots{}
#endif FOO
@end smallexample

@noindent
The second and third @code{FOO} should be in comments, but often are not
in older programs.  This warning is on by default.

@item -Wsystem-headers
@opindex Wsystem-headers
Issue warnings for code in system headers.  These are normally unhelpful
in finding bugs in your own code, therefore suppressed.  If you are
responsible for the system library, you may want to see them.

@item -w
@opindex w
Suppress all warnings, including those which GNU CPP issues by default.

@item -pedantic
@opindex pedantic
Issue all the mandatory diagnostics listed in the C standard.  Some of
them are left out by default, since they trigger frequently on harmless
code.

@item -pedantic-errors
@opindex pedantic-errors
Issue all the mandatory diagnostics, and make all mandatory diagnostics
into errors.  This includes mandatory diagnostics that LLVM issues
without @samp{-pedantic} but treats as warnings.

@item -M
@opindex M
@cindex @command{make}
@cindex dependencies, @command{make}
Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule
suitable for @command{make} describing the dependencies of the main
source file.  The preprocessor outputs one @command{make} rule containing
the object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all
the included files, including those coming from @option{-include} or
@option{-imacros} command line options.

Unless specified explicitly (with @option{-MT} or @option{-MQ}), the
object file name consists of the name of the source file with any
suffix replaced with object file suffix and with any leading directory
parts removed.  If there are many included files then the rule is
split into several lines using @samp{\}-newline.  The rule has no
commands.

This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug output, such as
@option{-dM}.  To avoid mixing such debug output with the dependency
rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output file with
@option{-MF}, or use an environment variable like
@env{DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT} (@pxref{Environment Variables}).  Debug output
will still be sent to the regular output stream as normal.

Passing @option{-M} to the driver implies @option{-E}, and suppresses
warnings with an implicit @option{-w}.

@item -MM
@opindex MM
Like @option{-M} but do not mention header files that are found in
system header directories, nor header files that are included,
directly or indirectly, from such a header.

This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an
@samp{#include} directive does not in itself determine whether that
header will appear in @option{-MM} dependency output.  This is a
slight change in semantics from GCC versions 3.0 and earlier.

@anchor{dashMF}
@item -MF @var{file}
@opindex MF
When used with @option{-M} or @option{-MM}, specifies a
file to write the dependencies to.  If no @option{-MF} switch is given
the preprocessor sends the rules to the same place it would have sent
preprocessed output.

When used with the driver options @option{-MD} or @option{-MMD},
@option{-MF} overrides the default dependency output file.

@item -MG
@opindex MG
In conjunction with an option such as @option{-M} requesting
dependency generation, @option{-MG} assumes missing header files are
generated files and adds them to the dependency list without raising
an error.  The dependency filename is taken directly from the
@code{#include} directive without prepending any path.  @option{-MG}
also suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header file renders
this useless.

This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.

@item -MP
@opindex MP
This option instructs CPP to add a phony target for each dependency
other than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing.  These
dummy rules work around errors @command{make} gives if you remove header
files without updating the @file{Makefile} to match.

This is typical output:

@smallexample
test.o: test.c test.h

test.h:
@end smallexample

@item -MT @var{target}
@opindex MT

Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.  By
default CPP takes the name of the main input file, deletes any
directory components and any file suffix such as @samp{.c}, and
appends the platform's usual object suffix.  The result is the target.

An @option{-MT} option will set the target to be exactly the string you
specify.  If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a single
argument to @option{-MT}, or use multiple @option{-MT} options.

For example, @option{@w{-MT '$(objpfx)foo.o'}} might give

@smallexample
$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c
@end smallexample

@item -MQ @var{target}
@opindex MQ

Same as @option{-MT}, but it quotes any characters which are special to
Make.  @option{@w{-MQ '$(objpfx)foo.o'}} gives

@smallexample
$$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c
@end smallexample

The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given with
@option{-MQ}.

@item -MD
@opindex MD
@option{-MD} is equivalent to @option{-M -MF @var{file}}, except that
@option{-E} is not implied.  The driver determines @var{file} based on
whether an @option{-o} option is given.  If it is, the driver uses its
argument but with a suffix of @file{.d}, otherwise it takes the name
of the input file, removes any directory components and suffix, and
applies a @file{.d} suffix.

If @option{-MD} is used in conjunction with @option{-E}, any
@option{-o} switch is understood to specify the dependency output file
(@pxref{dashMF,,-MF}), but if used without @option{-E}, each @option{-o}
is understood to specify a target object file.

Since @option{-E} is not implied, @option{-MD} can be used to generate
a dependency output file as a side-effect of the compilation process.

@item -MMD
@opindex MMD
Like @option{-MD} except mention only user header files, not system
header files.

@item -fpch-deps
@opindex fpch-deps
When using precompiled headers (@pxref{Precompiled Headers}), this flag
will cause the dependency-output flags to also list the files from the
precompiled header's dependencies.  If not specified only the
precompiled header would be listed and not the files that were used to
create it because those files are not consulted when a precompiled
header is used.

@item -fpch-preprocess
@opindex fpch-preprocess
This option allows use of a precompiled header (@pxref{Precompiled
Headers}) together with @option{-E}.  It inserts a special @code{#pragma},
@code{#pragma GCC pch_preprocess "@var{filename}"} in the output to mark
the place where the precompiled header was found, and its @var{filename}.
When @option{-fpreprocessed} is in use, LLVM recognizes this @code{#pragma}
and loads the PCH@.

This option is off by default, because the resulting preprocessed output
is only really suitable as input to LLVM@.  It is switched on by
@option{-save-temps}.

You should not write this @code{#pragma} in your own code, but it is
safe to edit the filename if the PCH file is available in a different
location.  The filename may be absolute or it may be relative to LLVM's
current directory.

@item -x c
@itemx -x c++
@itemx -x objective-c
@itemx -x assembler-with-cpp
@opindex x
Specify the source language: C, C++, Objective-C, or assembly.  This has
nothing to do with standards conformance or extensions; it merely
selects which base syntax to expect.  If you give none of these options,
cpp will deduce the language from the extension of the source file:
@samp{.c}, @samp{.cc}, @samp{.m}, or @samp{.S}.  Some other common
extensions for C++ and assembly are also recognized.  If cpp does not
recognize the extension, it will treat the file as C; this is the most
generic mode.

@emph{Note:} Previous versions of cpp accepted a @option{-lang} option
which selected both the language and the standards conformance level.
This option has been removed, because it conflicts with the @option{-l}
option.

@item -nostdinc
@opindex nostdinc
Do not search the standard system directories for header files.
Only the directories you have specified with @option{-I} options
(and the directory of the current file, if appropriate) are searched.

@item -nostdinc++
@anchor{op nostdinc++}
@opindex nostdinc++
Do not search for header files in the standard directories specific to
C++, but do still search the other standard directories.  (This option
is used when building the C++ library.)

@item -include @var{file}
@opindex include
Process @var{file} as if @code{#include "file"} appeared as the first
line of the primary source file.  However, the first directory searched
for @var{file} is the preprocessor's working directory @emph{instead of}
the directory containing the main source file.  If not found there, it
is searched for in the remainder of the @code{#include "@dots{}"} search
chain as normal.

If multiple @option{-include} options are given, the files are included
in the order they appear on the command line.

@item -imacros @var{file}
@opindex imacros
Exactly like @option{-include}, except that any output produced by
scanning @var{file} is thrown away.  Macros it defines remain defined.
This allows you to acquire all the macros from a header without also
processing its declarations.

All files specified by @option{-imacros} are processed before all files
specified by @option{-include}.

@item -idirafter @var{dir}
@opindex idirafter
Search @var{dir} for header files, but do it @emph{after} all
directories specified with @option{-I} and the standard system directories
have been exhausted.  @var{dir} is treated as a system include directory.
If @var{dir} begins with @code{=}, then the @code{=} will be replaced
by the sysroot prefix; see @option{--sysroot} and @option{-isysroot}.

@item -iprefix @var{prefix}
@opindex iprefix
Specify @var{prefix} as the prefix for subsequent @option{-iwithprefix}
options.  If the prefix represents a directory, you should include the
final @samp{/}.

@item -iwithprefix @var{dir}
@itemx -iwithprefixbefore @var{dir}
@opindex iwithprefix
@opindex iwithprefixbefore
Append @var{dir} to the prefix specified previously with
@option{-iprefix}, and add the resulting directory to the include search
path.  @option{-iwithprefixbefore} puts it in the same place @option{-I}
would; @option{-iwithprefix} puts it where @option{-idirafter} would.

@item -isysroot @var{dir}
@opindex isysroot
This option is like the @option{--sysroot} option, but applies only to
header files (except for Darwin targets, where it applies to both header
files and libraries).  See the @option{--sysroot} option for more
information.

@item -imultilib @var{dir}
@opindex imultilib
Use @var{dir} as a subdirectory of the directory containing
target-specific C++ headers.

@item -isystem @var{dir}
@opindex isystem
Search @var{dir} for header files, after all directories specified by
@option{-I} but before the standard system directories.  Mark it as a
system directory, so that it gets the same special treatment as is
applied to the standard system directories.  If @var{dir} begins with
@code{=}, then the @code{=} will be replaced by the sysroot prefix;
see @option{--sysroot} and @option{-isysroot}.

@item -fdirectives-only
@opindex fdirectives-only
When preprocessing, handle directives, but do not expand macros.

The option's behavior depends on the @option{-E} and @option{-fpreprocessed}
options.

With @option{-E}, preprocessing is limited to the handling of directives
such as @code{#define}, @code{#ifdef}, and @code{#error}.  Other
preprocessor operations, such as macro expansion and trigraph
conversion are not performed.  In addition, the @option{-dD} option is
implicitly enabled.

With @option{-fpreprocessed}, predefinition of command line and most
builtin macros is disabled.  Macros such as @code{__LINE__}, which are
contextually dependent, are handled normally.  This enables compilation of
files previously preprocessed with @code{-E -fdirectives-only}.

With both @option{-E} and @option{-fpreprocessed}, the rules for
@option{-fpreprocessed} take precedence.  This enables full preprocessing of
files previously preprocessed with @code{-E -fdirectives-only}.

@item -fdollars-in-identifiers
@opindex fdollars-in-identifiers
@anchor{fdollars-in-identifiers}
Accept @samp{$} in identifiers.

@item -fextended-identifiers
@opindex fextended-identifiers
Accept universal character names in identifiers.  This option is
enabled by default for C99 (and later C standard versions) and C++.

@item -fno-canonical-system-headers
@opindex fno-canonical-system-headers
When preprocessing, do not shorten system header paths with canonicalization.

@item -fpreprocessed
@opindex fpreprocessed
Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already been
preprocessed.  This suppresses things like macro expansion, trigraph
conversion, escaped newline splicing, and processing of most directives.
The preprocessor still recognizes and removes comments, so that you can
pass a file preprocessed with @option{-C} to the compiler without
problems.  In this mode the integrated preprocessor is little more than
a tokenizer for the front ends.

@option{-fpreprocessed} is implicit if the input file has one of the
extensions @samp{.i}, @samp{.ii} or @samp{.mi}.  These are the
extensions that LLVM uses for preprocessed files created by
@option{-save-temps}.

@item -ftabstop=@var{width}
@opindex ftabstop
Set the distance between tab stops.  This helps the preprocessor report
correct column numbers in warnings or errors, even if tabs appear on the
line.  If the value is less than 1 or greater than 100, the option is
ignored.  The default is 8.

@item -fdebug-cpp
@opindex fdebug-cpp
This option is only useful for debugging LLVM.  When used with
@option{-E}, dumps debugging information about location maps.  Every
token in the output is preceded by the dump of the map its location
belongs to.  The dump of the map holding the location of a token would
be:
@smallexample
@{@samp{P}:@file{/file/path};@samp{F}:@file{/includer/path};@samp{L}:@var{line_num};@samp{C}:@var{col_num};@samp{S}:@var{system_header_p};@samp{M}:@var{map_address};@samp{E}:@var{macro_expansion_p},@samp{loc}:@var{location}@}
@end smallexample

When used without @option{-E}, this option has no effect.

@item -ftrack-macro-expansion@r{[}=@var{level}@r{]}
@opindex ftrack-macro-expansion
Track locations of tokens across macro expansions. This allows the
compiler to emit diagnostic about the current macro expansion stack
when a compilation error occurs in a macro expansion. Using this
option makes the preprocessor and the compiler consume more
memory. The @var{level} parameter can be used to choose the level of
precision of token location tracking thus decreasing the memory
consumption if necessary. Value @samp{0} of @var{level} de-activates
this option just as if no @option{-ftrack-macro-expansion} was present
on the command line. Value @samp{1} tracks tokens locations in a
degraded mode for the sake of minimal memory overhead. In this mode
all tokens resulting from the expansion of an argument of a
function-like macro have the same location. Value @samp{2} tracks
tokens locations completely. This value is the most memory hungry.
When this option is given no argument, the default parameter value is
@samp{2}.

Note that @code{-ftrack-macro-expansion=2} is activated by default.

@item -fexec-charset=@var{charset}
@opindex fexec-charset
@cindex character set, execution
Set the execution character set, used for string and character
constants.  The default is UTF-8.  @var{charset} can be any encoding
supported by the system's @code{iconv} library routine.

@item -fwide-exec-charset=@var{charset}
@opindex fwide-exec-charset
@cindex character set, wide execution
Set the wide execution character set, used for wide string and
character constants.  The default is UTF-32 or UTF-16, whichever
corresponds to the width of @code{wchar_t}.  As with
@option{-fexec-charset}, @var{charset} can be any encoding supported
by the system's @code{iconv} library routine; however, you will have
problems with encodings that do not fit exactly in @code{wchar_t}.

@item -finput-charset=@var{charset}
@opindex finput-charset
@cindex character set, input
Set the input character set, used for translation from the character
set of the input file to the source character set used by LLVM@.  If the
locale does not specify, or LLVM cannot get this information from the
locale, the default is UTF-8.  This can be overridden by either the locale
or this command line option.  Currently the command line option takes
precedence if there's a conflict.  @var{charset} can be any encoding
supported by the system's @code{iconv} library routine.

@item -fworking-directory
@opindex fworking-directory
@opindex fno-working-directory
Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output that will
let the compiler know the current working directory at the time of
preprocessing.  When this option is enabled, the preprocessor will
emit, after the initial linemarker, a second linemarker with the
current working directory followed by two slashes.  LLVM will use this
directory, when it's present in the preprocessed input, as the
directory emitted as the current working directory in some debugging
information formats.  This option is implicitly enabled if debugging
information is enabled, but this can be inhibited with the negated
form @option{-fno-working-directory}.  If the @option{-P} flag is
present in the command line, this option has no effect, since no
@code{#line} directives are emitted whatsoever.

@item -fno-show-column
@opindex fno-show-column
Do not print column numbers in diagnostics.  This may be necessary if
diagnostics are being scanned by a program that does not understand the
column numbers, such as @command{dejagnu}.

@item -A @var{predicate}=@var{answer}
@opindex A
Make an assertion with the predicate @var{predicate} and answer
@var{answer}.  This form is preferred to the older form @option{-A
@var{predicate}(@var{answer})}, which is still supported, because
it does not use shell special characters.

@item -A -@var{predicate}=@var{answer}
Cancel an assertion with the predicate @var{predicate} and answer
@var{answer}.

@item -dCHARS
@var{CHARS} is a sequence of one or more of the following characters,
and must not be preceded by a space.  Other characters are interpreted
by the compiler proper, or reserved for future versions of LLVM, and so
are silently ignored.  If you specify characters whose behavior
conflicts, the result is undefined.

@table @samp
@item M
@opindex dM
Instead of the normal output, generate a list of @samp{#define}
directives for all the macros defined during the execution of the
preprocessor, including predefined macros.  This gives you a way of
finding out what is predefined in your version of the preprocessor.
Assuming you have no file @file{foo.h}, the command

@smallexample
touch foo.h; cpp -dM foo.h
@end smallexample

@noindent
will show all the predefined macros.

If you use @option{-dM} without the @option{-E} option, @option{-dM} is
interpreted as a synonym for @option{-fdump-rtl-mach}.
@xref{Debugging Options, , ,gcc}.

@item D
@opindex dD
Like @samp{M} except in two respects: it does @emph{not} include the
predefined macros, and it outputs @emph{both} the @samp{#define}
directives and the result of preprocessing.  Both kinds of output go to
the standard output file.

@item N
@opindex dN
Like @samp{D}, but emit only the macro names, not their expansions.

@item I
@opindex dI
Output @samp{#include} directives in addition to the result of
preprocessing.

@item U
@opindex dU
Like @samp{D} except that only macros that are expanded, or whose
definedness is tested in preprocessor directives, are output; the
output is delayed until the use or test of the macro; and
@samp{#undef} directives are also output for macros tested but
undefined at the time.
@end table

@item -P
@opindex P
Inhibit generation of linemarkers in the output from the preprocessor.
This might be useful when running the preprocessor on something that is
not C code, and will be sent to a program which might be confused by the
linemarkers.

@item -C
@opindex C
Do not discard comments.  All comments are passed through to the output
file, except for comments in processed directives, which are deleted
along with the directive.

You should be prepared for side effects when using @option{-C}; it
causes the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their own right.
For example, comments appearing at the start of what would be a
directive line have the effect of turning that line into an ordinary
source line, since the first token on the line is no longer a @samp{#}.

@item -CC
Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion.  This is
like @option{-C}, except that comments contained within macros are
also passed through to the output file where the macro is expanded.

In addition to the side-effects of the @option{-C} option, the
@option{-CC} option causes all C++-style comments inside a macro
to be converted to C-style comments.  This is to prevent later use
of that macro from inadvertently commenting out the remainder of
the source line.

The @option{-CC} option is generally used to support lint comments.

@item -remap
@opindex remap
Enable special code to work around file systems which only permit very
short file names, such as MS-DOS@.

@item -H
@opindex H
Print the name of each header file used, in addition to other normal
activities.  Each name is indented to show how deep in the
@samp{#include} stack it is.  Precompiled header files are also
printed, even if they are found to be invalid; an invalid precompiled
header file is printed with @samp{...x} and a valid one with @samp{...!} .

These options come into play when the compiler links object files into
an executable output file.  They are meaningless if the compiler is
not doing a link step.

@table @gcctabopt
@cindex file names
@item @var{object-file-name}
A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix is
considered to name an object file or library.  (Object files are
distinguished from libraries by the linker according to the file
contents.)  If linking is done, these object files are used as input
to the linker.

@item -c
@itemx -S
@itemx -E
@opindex c
@opindex S
@opindex E
If any of these options is used, then the linker is not run, and
object file names should not be used as arguments.  @xref{Overall
Options}.

@item -fuse-ld=bfd
@opindex fuse-ld=bfd
Use the @command{bfd} linker instead of the default linker.

@item -fuse-ld=gold
@opindex fuse-ld=gold
Use the @command{gold} linker instead of the default linker.

@cindex Libraries
@item -l@var{library}
@itemx -l @var{library}
@opindex l
Search the library named @var{library} when linking.  (The second
alternative with the library as a separate argument is only for
POSIX compliance and is not recommended.)

It makes a difference where in the command you write this option; the
linker searches and processes libraries and object files in the order they
are specified.  Thus, @samp{foo.o -lz bar.o} searches library @samp{z}
after file @file{foo.o} but before @file{bar.o}.  If @file{bar.o} refers
to functions in @samp{z}, those functions may not be loaded.

The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library,
which is actually a file named @file{lib@var{library}.a}.  The linker
then uses this file as if it had been specified precisely by name.

The directories searched include several standard system directories
plus any that you specify with @option{-L}.

Normally the files found this way are library files---archive files
whose members are object files.  The linker handles an archive file by
scanning through it for members which define symbols that have so far
been referenced but not defined.  But if the file that is found is an
ordinary object file, it is linked in the usual fashion.  The only
difference between using an @option{-l} option and specifying a file name
is that @option{-l} surrounds @var{library} with @samp{lib} and @samp{.a}
and searches several directories.

@item -lobjc
@opindex lobjc
You need this special case of the @option{-l} option in order to
link an Objective-C or Objective-C++ program.

@item -nostartfiles
@opindex nostartfiles
Do not use the standard system startup files when linking.
The standard system libraries are used normally, unless @option{-nostdlib}
or @option{-nodefaultlibs} is used.

@item -nodefaultlibs
@opindex nodefaultlibs
Do not use the standard system libraries when linking.
Only the libraries you specify are passed to the linker, and options
specifying linkage of the system libraries, such as @option{-static-libgcc}
or @option{-shared-libgcc}, are ignored.
The standard startup files are used normally, unless @option{-nostartfiles}
is used.

The compiler may generate calls to @code{memcmp},
@code{memset}, @code{memcpy} and @code{memmove}.
These entries are usually resolved by entries in
libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other
mechanism when this option is specified.

@item -nostdlib
@opindex nostdlib
Do not use the standard system startup files or libraries when linking.
No startup files and only the libraries you specify are passed to
the linker, and options specifying linkage of the system libraries, such as
@option{-static-libgcc} or @option{-shared-libgcc}, are ignored.

The compiler may generate calls to @code{memcmp}, @code{memset},
@code{memcpy} and @code{memmove}.

@cindex unresolved references and @option{-nodefaultlibs}
One of the standard libraries bypassed by @option{-nostdlib} and
@option{-nodefaultlibs} is @file{libgcc.a}, a library of internal subroutines
which LLVM uses to overcome shortcomings of particular machines, or special
needs for some languages.
(@xref{Interface,,Interfacing to GCC Output,gccint,GNU Compiler
Collection (GCC) Internals},
for more discussion of @file{libgcc.a}.)
In most cases, you need @file{libgcc.a} even when you want to avoid
other standard libraries.  In other words, when you specify @option{-nostdlib}
or @option{-nodefaultlibs} you should usually specify @option{-lgcc} as well.
This ensures that you have no unresolved references to internal LLVM
library subroutines.
(An example of such an internal subroutine is @code{__main}, used to ensure C++
constructors are called; @pxref{Collect2,,@code{collect2}, gccint,
GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) Internals}.)

@item -pie
@opindex pie
Produce a position independent executable on targets that support it.
For predictable results, you must also specify the same set of options
used for compilation (@option{-fpie}, @option{-fPIE},
or model suboptions) when you specify this linker option.

@item -rdynamic
@opindex rdynamic
Pass the flag @option{-export-dynamic} to the ELF linker, on targets
that support it. This instructs the linker to add all symbols, not
only used ones, to the dynamic symbol table. This option is needed
for some uses of @code{dlopen} or to allow obtaining backtraces
from within a program.

@item -s
@opindex s
Remove all symbol table and relocation information from the executable.

@item -static
@opindex static
On systems that support dynamic linking, this prevents linking with the shared
libraries.  On other systems, this option has no effect.

@item -shared
@opindex shared
Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other objects to
form an executable.  Not all systems support this option.  For predictable
results, you must also specify the same set of options used for compilation
(@option{-fpic}, @option{-fPIC}, or model suboptions) when
you specify this linker option.@footnote{On some systems, @samp{gcc -shared}
needs to build supplementary stub code for constructors to work.  On
multi-libbed systems, @samp{gcc -shared} must select the correct support
libraries to link against.  Failing to supply the correct flags may lead
to subtle defects.  Supplying them in cases where they are not necessary
is innocuous.}

@item -shared-libgcc
@itemx -static-libgcc
@opindex shared-libgcc
@opindex static-libgcc
On systems that provide @file{libgcc} as a shared library, these options
force the use of either the shared or static version, respectively.
If no shared version of @file{libgcc} was built when the compiler was
configured, these options have no effect.

There are several situations in which an application should use the
shared @file{libgcc} instead of the static version.  The most common
of these is when the application wishes to throw and catch exceptions
across different shared libraries.  In that case, each of the libraries
as well as the application itself should use the shared @file{libgcc}.

Therefore, the G++ and GCJ drivers automatically add
@option{-shared-libgcc} whenever you build a shared library or a main
executable, because C++ and Java programs typically use exceptions, so
this is the right thing to do.

If, instead, you use the LLVM driver to create shared libraries, you may
find that they are not always linked with the shared @file{libgcc}.
If LLVM finds, at its configuration time, that you have a non-GNU linker
or a GNU linker that does not support option @option{--eh-frame-hdr},
it links the shared version of @file{libgcc} into shared libraries
by default.  Otherwise, it takes advantage of the linker and optimizes
away the linking with the shared version of @file{libgcc}, linking with
the static version of libgcc by default.  This allows exceptions to
propagate through such shared libraries, without incurring relocation
costs at library load time.

However, if a library or main executable is supposed to throw or catch
exceptions, you must link it using the G++ or GCJ driver, as appropriate
for the languages used in the program, or using the option
@option{-shared-libgcc}, such that it is linked with the shared
@file{libgcc}.

@item -static-libasan
@opindex static-libasan
When the @option{-fsanitize=address} option is used to link a program,
the LLVM driver automatically links against @option{libasan}.  If
@file{libasan} is available as a shared library, and the @option{-static}
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
@file{libasan}.  The @option{-static-libasan} option directs the LLVM
driver to link @file{libasan} statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.

@item -static-libtsan
@opindex static-libtsan
When the @option{-fsanitize=thread} option is used to link a program,
the LLVM driver automatically links against @option{libtsan}.  If
@file{libtsan} is available as a shared library, and the @option{-static}
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
@file{libtsan}.  The @option{-static-libtsan} option directs the LLVM
driver to link @file{libtsan} statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.

@item -static-liblsan
@opindex static-liblsan
When the @option{-fsanitize=leak} option is used to link a program,
the LLVM driver automatically links against @option{liblsan}.  If
@file{liblsan} is available as a shared library, and the @option{-static}
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
@file{liblsan}.  The @option{-static-liblsan} option directs the LLVM
driver to link @file{liblsan} statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.

@item -static-libubsan
@opindex static-libubsan
When the @option{-fsanitize=undefined} option is used to link a program,
the LLVM driver automatically links against @option{libubsan}.  If
@file{libubsan} is available as a shared library, and the @option{-static}
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
@file{libubsan}.  The @option{-static-libubsan} option directs the LLVM
driver to link @file{libubsan} statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.

@item -static-libmpx
@opindex static-libmpx
When @option{-fcheck-pointer bounds} and @option{-mmpx} options are
used to link a program, the LLVM driver automatically links against
@option{libmpx}.  If @file{libmpx} is available as a shared library,
and the @option{-static} option is not used, then this links against
the shared version of @file{libmpx}.  The @option{-static-libmpx}
option directs the LLVM driver to link @file{libmpx} statically,
without necessarily linking other libraries statically.

@item -static-libmpxwrappers
@opindex static-libmpxwrappers
When @option{-fcheck-pointer bounds}, @option{-mmpx} options are used and
@option{-fno-chkp-use-wrappers} option is not used to link a program, the
LLVM driver automatically links against @option{libmpxwrappers}.  If
@file{libmpxwrappers} is available as a shared library, and the
@option{-static} option is not used, then this links against the shared
version of @file{libmpxwrappers}.  The @option{-static-libmpxwrappers}
option directs the LLVM driver to link @file{libmpxwrappers} statically,
without necessarily linking other libraries statically.

@item -static-libstdc++
@opindex static-libstdc++
When the @command{g++} program is used to link a C++ program, it
normally automatically links against @option{libstdc++}.  If
@file{libstdc++} is available as a shared library, and the
@option{-static} option is not used, then this links against the
shared version of @file{libstdc++}.  That is normally fine.  However, it
is sometimes useful to freeze the version of @file{libstdc++} used by
the program without going all the way to a fully static link.  The
@option{-static-libstdc++} option directs the @command{g++} driver to
link @file{libstdc++} statically, without necessarily linking other
libraries statically.

@item -symbolic
@opindex symbolic
Bind references to global symbols when building a shared object.  Warn
about any unresolved references (unless overridden by the link editor
option @option{-Xlinker -z -Xlinker defs}).  Only a few systems support
this option.

@item -T @var{script}
@opindex T
@cindex linker script
Use @var{script} as the linker script.  This option is supported by most
systems using the GNU linker.  On some targets, such as bare-board
targets without an operating system, the @option{-T} option may be required
when linking to avoid references to undefined symbols.

@item -Xlinker @var{option}
@opindex Xlinker
Pass @var{option} as an option to the linker.  You can use this to
supply system-specific linker options that LLVM does not recognize.

If you want to pass an option that takes a separate argument, you must use
@option{-Xlinker} twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
For example, to pass @option{-assert definitions}, you must write
@option{-Xlinker -assert -Xlinker definitions}.  It does not work to write
@option{-Xlinker "-assert definitions"}, because this passes the entire
string as a single argument, which is not what the linker expects.

When using the GNU linker, it is usually more convenient to pass
arguments to linker options using the @option{@var{option}=@var{value}}
syntax than as separate arguments.  For example, you can specify
@option{-Xlinker -Map=output.map} rather than
@option{-Xlinker -Map -Xlinker output.map}.  Other linkers may not support
this syntax for command-line options.

@item -Wl,@var{option}
@opindex Wl
Pass @var{option} as an option to the linker.  If @var{option} contains
commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.  You can use this
syntax to pass an argument to the option.
For example, @option{-Wl,-Map,output.map} passes @option{-Map output.map} to the
linker.  When using the GNU linker, you can also get the same effect with
@option{-Wl,-Map=output.map}.

@item -u @var{symbol}
@opindex u
Pretend the symbol @var{symbol} is undefined, to force linking of
library modules to define it.  You can use @option{-u} multiple times with
different symbols to force loading of additional library modules.

@item -z @var{keyword}
@opindex z
@option{-z} is passed directly on to the linker along with the keyword
@var{keyword}. See the section in the documentation of your linker for
permitted values and their meanings.

These options specify directories to search for header files, for
libraries and for parts of the compiler:

@table @gcctabopt
@item -no-canonical-prefixes
@opindex no-canonical-prefixes
Do not expand any symbolic links, resolve references to @samp{/../}
or @samp{/./}, or make the path absolute when generating a relative
prefix.

@emph{Note:} This behaves slightly differently with Clang/LLVM
compared to GCC.  The absence of paths even applies to the
@command{clang} command itself, when it is reinvoked by the driver.
So the command must be a fully qualified filename.

@item -I@var{dir}
@opindex I
Add the directory @var{dir} to the head of the list of directories to be
searched for header files.  This can be used to override a system header
file, substituting your own version, since these directories are
searched before the system header file directories.  However, you should
not use this option to add directories that contain vendor-supplied
system header files (use @option{-isystem} for that).  If you use more than
one @option{-I} option, the directories are scanned in left-to-right
order; the standard system directories come after.

If a standard system include directory, or a directory specified with
@option{-isystem}, is also specified with @option{-I}, the @option{-I}
option is ignored.  The directory is still searched but as a
system directory at its normal position in the system include chain.
This is to ensure that LLVM's procedure to fix buggy system headers and
the ordering for the @code{include_next} directive are not inadvertently changed.
If you really need to change the search order for system directories,
use the @option{-nostdinc} and/or @option{-isystem} options.

@item -iplugindir=@var{dir}
@opindex iplugindir=
Set the directory to search for plugins that are passed
by @option{-fplugin=@var{name}} instead of
@option{-fplugin=@var{path}/@var{name}.so}.  This option is not meant
to be used by the user, but only passed by the driver.

@item -iquote@var{dir}
@opindex iquote
Add the directory @var{dir} to the head of the list of directories to
be searched for header files only for the case of @code{#include
"@var{file}"}; they are not searched for @code{#include <@var{file}>},
otherwise just like @option{-I}.

@item -L@var{dir}
@opindex L
Add directory @var{dir} to the list of directories to be searched
for @option{-l}.

@item -B@var{prefix}
@opindex B
This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries,
include files, and data files of the compiler itself.

The compiler driver program runs one or more of the subprograms
@command{cpp}, @command{cc1}, @command{as} and @command{ld}.  It tries
@var{prefix} as a prefix for each program it tries to run, both with and
without @samp{@var{machine}/@var{version}/} for the corresponding target
machine and compiler version.

For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries the
@option{-B} prefix, if any.  If that name is not found, or if @option{-B}
is not specified, the driver tries two standard prefixes,
@file{/usr/lib/gcc/} and @file{/usr/local/lib/gcc/}.  If neither of
those results in a file name that is found, the unmodified program
name is searched for using the directories specified in your
@env{PATH} environment variable.

The compiler checks to see if the path provided by the @option{-B}
refers to a directory, and if necessary it adds a directory
separator character at the end of the path.

@option{-B} prefixes that effectively specify directory names also apply
to libraries in the linker, because the compiler translates these
options into @option{-L} options for the linker.  They also apply to
include files in the preprocessor, because the compiler translates these
options into @option{-isystem} options for the preprocessor.  In this case,
the compiler appends @samp{include} to the prefix.

The runtime support file @file{libgcc.a} can also be searched for using
the @option{-B} prefix, if needed.  If it is not found there, the two
standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all.  The file is left
out of the link if it is not found by those means.

Another way to specify a prefix much like the @option{-B} prefix is to use
the environment variable @env{GCC_EXEC_PREFIX}.  @xref{Environment
Variables}.

As a special kludge, if the path provided by @option{-B} is
@file{[dir/]stage@var{N}/}, where @var{N} is a number in the range 0 to
9, then it is replaced by @file{[dir/]include}.  This is to help
with boot-strapping the compiler.

@item -specs=@var{file}
@opindex specs
Process @var{file} after the compiler reads in the standard @file{specs}
file, in order to override the defaults which the @command{clang} driver
program uses when determining what switches to pass to @command{cc1},
@command{cc1plus}, @command{as}, @command{ld}, etc.  More than one
@option{-specs=@var{file}} can be specified on the command line, and they
are processed in order, from left to right.

@item --sysroot=@var{dir}
@opindex sysroot
Use @var{dir} as the logical root directory for headers and libraries.
For example, if the compiler normally searches for headers in
@file{/usr/include} and libraries in @file{/usr/lib}, it instead
searches @file{@var{dir}/usr/include} and @file{@var{dir}/usr/lib}.

If you use both this option and the @option{-isysroot} option, then
the @option{--sysroot} option applies to libraries, but the
@option{-isysroot} option applies to header files.

The GNU linker (beginning with version 2.16) has the necessary support
for this option.  If your linker does not support this option, the
header file aspect of @option{--sysroot} still works, but the
library aspect does not.

@item --no-sysroot-suffix
@opindex no-sysroot-suffix
For some targets, a suffix is added to the root directory specified
with @option{--sysroot}, depending on the other options used, so that
headers may for example be found in
@file{@var{dir}/@var{suffix}/usr/include} instead of
@file{@var{dir}/usr/include}.  This option disables the addition of
such a suffix.

@item -I-
@opindex I-
This option has been deprecated.  Please use @option{-iquote} instead for
@option{-I} directories before the @option{-I-} and remove the @option{-I-}.
Any directories you specify with @option{-I} options before the @option{-I-}
option are searched only for the case of @code{#include "@var{file}"};
they are not searched for @code{#include <@var{file}>}.

If additional directories are specified with @option{-I} options after
the @option{-I-}, these directories are searched for all @code{#include}
directives.  (Ordinarily @emph{all} @option{-I} directories are used
this way.)

In addition, the @option{-I-} option inhibits the use of the current
directory (where the current input file came from) as the first search
directory for @code{#include "@var{file}"}.  There is no way to
override this effect of @option{-I-}.  With @option{-I.} you can specify
searching the directory that is current when the compiler is
invoked.  That is not exactly the same as what the preprocessor does
by default, but it is often satisfactory.

@option{-I-} does not inhibit the use of the standard system directories
for header files.  Thus, @option{-I-} and @option{-nostdinc} are
independent.

These machine-independent options control the interface conventions

Most of them have both positive and negative forms; the negative form

one of the forms is listed---the one that is not the default.  You

it.

@table @gcctabopt
@item -fstack-reuse=@var{reuse-level}
@opindex fstack_reuse
This option controls stack space reuse for user declared local/auto variables
and compiler generated temporaries.  @var{reuse_level} can be @samp{all},
@samp{named_vars}, or @samp{none}. @samp{all} enables stack reuse for all
local variables and temporaries, @samp{named_vars} enables the reuse only for
user defined local variables with names, and @samp{none} disables stack reuse
completely. The default value is @samp{all}. The option is needed when the
program extends the lifetime of a scoped local variable or a compiler generated
temporary beyond the end point defined by the language.  When a lifetime of
a variable ends, and if the variable lives in memory, the optimizing compiler
has the freedom to reuse its stack space with other temporaries or scoped
local variables whose live range does not overlap with it. Legacy code extending
local lifetime is likely to break with the stack reuse optimization.

For example,

@smallexample
   int *p;
   @{
     int local1;

     p = &local1;
     local1 = 10;
     ....
   @}
   @{
      int local2;
      local2 = 20;
      ...
   @}

   if (*p == 10)  // out of scope use of local1
     @{

     @}
@end smallexample

Another example:
@smallexample

   struct A
   @{
       A(int k) : i(k), j(k) @{ @}
       int i;
       int j;
   @};

   A *ap;

   void foo(const A& ar)
   @{
      ap = &ar;
   @}

   void bar()
   @{
      foo(A(10)); // temp object's lifetime ends when foo returns

      @{
        A a(20);
        ....
      @}
      ap->i+= 10;  // ap references out of scope temp whose space
                   // is reused with a. What is the value of ap->i?
   @}

@end smallexample

The lifetime of a compiler generated temporary is well defined by the C++
standard. When a lifetime of a temporary ends, and if the temporary lives
in memory, the optimizing compiler has the freedom to reuse its stack
space with other temporaries or scoped local variables whose live range
does not overlap with it. However some of the legacy code relies on
the behavior of older compilers in which temporaries' stack space is
not reused, the aggressive stack reuse can lead to runtime errors. This
option is used to control the temporary stack reuse optimization.

@item -ftrapv
@opindex ftrapv
This option generates traps for signed overflow on addition, subtraction,
multiplication operations.

@item -fwrapv
@opindex fwrapv
This option instructs the compiler to assume that signed arithmetic
overflow of addition, subtraction and multiplication wraps around
using twos-complement representation.  This flag enables some optimizations
and disables others.  This option is enabled by default for the Java
front end, as required by the Java language specification.

@item -fexceptions
@opindex fexceptions
Enable exception handling.  Generates extra code needed to propagate
exceptions.  For some targets, this implies LLVM generates frame
unwind information for all functions, which can produce significant data
size overhead, although it does not affect execution.  If you do not
specify this option, LLVM enables it by default for languages like
C++ that normally require exception handling, and disables it for
languages like C that do not normally require it.  However, you may need
to enable this option when compiling C code that needs to interoperate
properly with exception handlers written in C++.  You may also wish to
disable this option if you are compiling older C++ programs that don't
use exception handling.

@item -fnon-call-exceptions
@opindex fnon-call-exceptions
Generate code that allows trapping instructions to throw exceptions.
Note that this requires platform-specific runtime support that does
not exist everywhere.  Moreover, it only allows @emph{trapping}
instructions to throw exceptions, i.e.@: memory references or floating-point
instructions.  It does not allow exceptions to be thrown from
arbitrary signal handlers such as @code{SIGALRM}.

@item -fdelete-dead-exceptions
@opindex fdelete-dead-exceptions
Consider that instructions that may throw exceptions but don't otherwise
contribute to the execution of the program can be optimized away.
This option is enabled by default for the Ada front end, as permitted by
the Ada language specification.
Optimization passes that cause dead exceptions to be removed are enabled independently at different optimization levels.

@item -funwind-tables
@opindex funwind-tables
Similar to @option{-fexceptions}, except that it just generates any needed
static data, but does not affect the generated code in any other way.
You normally do not need to enable this option; instead, a language processor
that needs this handling enables it on your behalf.

@item -fasynchronous-unwind-tables
@opindex fasynchronous-unwind-tables
Generate unwind table in DWARF 2 format, if supported by target machine.  The
table is exact at each instruction boundary, so it can be used for stack
unwinding from asynchronous events (such as debugger or garbage collector).

@item -fno-gnu-unique
@opindex fno-gnu-unique
On systems with recent GNU assembler and C library, the C++ compiler
uses the @code{STB_GNU_UNIQUE} binding to make sure that definitions
of template static data members and static local variables in inline
functions are unique even in the presence of @code{RTLD_LOCAL}; this
is necessary to avoid problems with a library used by two different
@code{RTLD_LOCAL} plugins depending on a definition in one of them and
therefore disagreeing with the other one about the binding of the
symbol.  But this causes @code{dlclose} to be ignored for affected
DSOs; if your program relies on reinitialization of a DSO via
@code{dlclose} and @code{dlopen}, you can use
@option{-fno-gnu-unique}.

@item -fpcc-struct-return
@opindex fpcc-struct-return
Return ``short'' @code{struct} and @code{union} values in memory like
longer ones, rather than in registers.  This convention is less
efficient, but it has the advantage of allowing intercallability between
LLVM-compiled files and files compiled with other compilers, particularly
the Portable C Compiler (pcc).

The precise convention for returning structures in memory depends
on the target configuration macros.

Short structures and unions are those whose size and alignment match
that of some integer type.

@strong{Warning:} code compiled with the @option{-fpcc-struct-return}
switch is not binary compatible with code compiled with the
@option{-freg-struct-return} switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.

@item -freg-struct-return
@opindex freg-struct-return
Return @code{struct} and @code{union} values in registers when possible.
This is more efficient for small structures than
@option{-fpcc-struct-return}.

If you specify neither @option{-fpcc-struct-return} nor
@option{-freg-struct-return}, LLVM defaults to whichever convention is
standard for the target.  If there is no standard convention, LLVM
defaults to @option{-fpcc-struct-return}, except on targets where LLVM is
the principal compiler.  In those cases, we can choose the standard, and
we chose the more efficient register return alternative.

@strong{Warning:} code compiled with the @option{-freg-struct-return}
switch is not binary compatible with code compiled with the
@option{-fpcc-struct-return} switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.

@item -fshort-enums
@opindex fshort-enums
Allocate to an @code{enum} type only as many bytes as it needs for the
declared range of possible values.  Specifically, the @code{enum} type
is equivalent to the smallest integer type that has enough room.

@strong{Warning:} the @option{-fshort-enums} switch causes LLVM to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.

@item -fshort-double
@opindex fshort-double
Use the same size for @code{double} as for @code{float}.

@strong{Warning:} the @option{-fshort-double} switch causes LLVM to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.

@item -fshort-wchar
@opindex fshort-wchar
Override the underlying type for @code{wchar_t} to be @code{short
unsigned int} instead of the default for the target.  This option is
useful for building programs to run under WINE@.

@strong{Warning:} the @option{-fshort-wchar} switch causes LLVM to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.

@item -fno-common
@opindex fno-common
In C code, controls the placement of uninitialized global variables.
Unix C compilers have traditionally permitted multiple definitions of
such variables in different compilation units by placing the variables
in a common block.
This is the behavior specified by @option{-fcommon}, and is the default
for LLVM on most targets.
On the other hand, this behavior is not required by ISO C, and on some
targets may carry a speed or code size penalty on variable references.
The @option{-fno-common} option specifies that the compiler should place
uninitialized global variables in the data section of the object file,
rather than generating them as common blocks.
This has the effect that if the same variable is declared
(without @code{extern}) in two different compilations,
you get a multiple-definition error when you link them.
In this case, you must compile with @option{-fcommon} instead.
Compiling with @option{-fno-common} is useful on targets for which
it provides better performance, or if you wish to verify that the
program will work on other systems that always treat uninitialized
variable declarations this way.

@item -fno-ident
@opindex fno-ident
Ignore the @code{#ident} directive.

@item -finhibit-size-directive
@opindex finhibit-size-directive
Don't output a @code{.size} assembler directive, or anything else that
would cause trouble if the function is split in the middle, and the
two halves are placed at locations far apart in memory.  This option is
used when compiling @file{crtstuff.c}; you should not need to use it
for anything else.

@item -fverbose-asm
@opindex fverbose-asm
Put extra commentary information in the generated assembly code to
make it more readable.  This option is generally only of use to those
who actually need to read the generated assembly code (perhaps while
debugging the compiler itself).

@option{-fno-verbose-asm}, the default, causes the
extra information to be omitted and is useful when comparing two assembler
files.

@item -frecord-gcc-switches
@opindex frecord-gcc-switches
This switch causes the command line used to invoke the
compiler to be recorded into the object file that is being created.
This switch is only implemented on some targets and the exact format
of the recording is target and binary file format dependent, but it
usually takes the form of a section containing ASCII text.  This
switch is related to the @option{-fverbose-asm} switch, but that
switch only records information in the assembler output file as
comments, so it never reaches the object file.
See also @option{-grecord-gcc-switches} for another
way of storing compiler options into the object file.

@item -fpic
@opindex fpic
@cindex global offset table
@cindex PIC
Generate position-independent code (PIC) suitable for use in a shared
library, if supported for the target machine.  Such code accesses all
constant addresses through a global offset table (GOT)@.  The dynamic
loader resolves the GOT entries when the program starts (the dynamic
loader is not part of LLVM; it is part of the operating system).  If
the GOT size for the linked executable exceeds a machine-specific
maximum size, you get an error message from the linker indicating that
@option{-fpic} does not work; in that case, recompile with @option{-fPIC}
instead.  (These maximums are 8k on the SPARC and 32k
on the m68k and RS/6000.  The x86 has no such limit.)

Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.  For the x86, LLVM supports PIC for System V
but not for the Sun 386i.  Code generated for the IBM RS/6000 is always
position-independent.

When this flag is set, the macros @code{__pic__} and @code{__PIC__}
are defined to 1.

@item -fPIC
@opindex fPIC
If supported for the target machine, emit position-independent code,
suitable for dynamic linking and avoiding any limit on the size of the
global offset table.  This option makes a difference on the m68k,
PowerPC and SPARC@.

Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.

When this flag is set, the macros @code{__pic__} and @code{__PIC__}
are defined to 2.

@item -fpie
@itemx -fPIE
@opindex fpie
@opindex fPIE
These options are similar to @option{-fpic} and @option{-fPIC}, but
generated position independent code can be only linked into executables.
Usually these options are used when @option{-pie} LLVM option is
used during linking.

@option{-fpie} and @option{-fPIE} both define the macros
@code{__pie__} and @code{__PIE__}.  The macros have the value 1
for @option{-fpie} and 2 for @option{-fPIE}.

@item -fno-jump-tables
@opindex fno-jump-tables
Do not use jump tables for switch statements even where it would be
more efficient than other code generation strategies.  This option is
of use in conjunction with @option{-fpic} or @option{-fPIC} for
building code that forms part of a dynamic linker and cannot
reference the address of a jump table.  On some targets, jump tables
do not require a GOT and this option is not needed.

@item -ffixed-@var{reg}
@opindex ffixed
Treat the register named @var{reg} as a fixed register; generated code
should never refer to it (except perhaps as a stack pointer, frame
pointer or in some other fixed role).

@var{reg} must be the name of a register.  The register names accepted
are machine-specific and are defined in the @code{REGISTER_NAMES}
macro in the machine description macro file.

This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.

@item -fcall-used-@var{reg}
@opindex fcall-used
Treat the register named @var{reg} as an allocable register that is
clobbered by function calls.  It may be allocated for temporaries or
variables that do not live across a call.  Functions compiled this way
do not save and restore the register @var{reg}.

It is an error to use this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer.
Use of this flag for other registers that have fixed pervasive roles in
the machine's execution model produces disastrous results.

This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.

@item -fcall-saved-@var{reg}
@opindex fcall-saved
Treat the register named @var{reg} as an allocable register saved by
functions.  It may be allocated even for temporaries or variables that
live across a call.  Functions compiled this way save and restore
the register @var{reg} if they use it.

It is an error to use this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer.
Use of this flag for other registers that have fixed pervasive roles in
the machine's execution model produces disastrous results.

A different sort of disaster results from the use of this flag for
a register in which function values may be returned.

This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.

@item -fpack-struct[=@var{n}]
@opindex fpack-struct
Without a value specified, pack all structure members together without
holes.  When a value is specified (which must be a small power of two), pack
structure members according to this value, representing the maximum
alignment (that is, objects with default alignment requirements larger than
this are output potentially unaligned at the next fitting location.

@strong{Warning:} the @option{-fpack-struct} switch causes LLVM to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Additionally, it makes the code suboptimal.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.

@item -finstrument-functions
@opindex finstrument-functions
Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to functions.  Just
after function entry and just before function exit, the following
profiling functions are called with the address of the current
function and its call site.  (On some platforms,
@code{__builtin_return_address} does not work beyond the current
function, so the call site information may not be available to the
profiling functions otherwise.)

@smallexample
void __cyg_profile_func_enter (void *this_fn,
                               void *call_site);
void __cyg_profile_func_exit  (void *this_fn,
                               void *call_site);
@end smallexample

The first argument is the address of the start of the current function,
which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table.

This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded inline in other
functions.  The profiling calls indicate where, conceptually, the
inline function is entered and exited.  This means that addressable
versions of such functions must be available.  If all your uses of a
function are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion of
code size.  If you use @code{extern inline} in your C code, an
addressable version of such functions must be provided.  (This is
normally the case anyway, but if you get lucky and the optimizer always
expands the functions inline, you might have gotten away without
providing static copies.)

A function may be given the attribute @code{no_instrument_function}, in
which case this instrumentation is not done.  This can be used, for
example, for the profiling functions listed above, high-priority
interrupt routines, and any functions from which the profiling functions
cannot safely be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the profiling
routines generate output or allocate memory).

@item -fleading-underscore
@opindex fleading-underscore
This option and its counterpart, @option{-fno-leading-underscore}, forcibly
change the way C symbols are represented in the object file.  One use
is to help link with legacy assembly code.

@strong{Warning:} the @option{-fleading-underscore} switch causes LLVM to
generate code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that
switch.  Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
Not all targets provide complete support for this switch.

@item -ftls-model=@var{model}
@opindex ftls-model
Alter the thread-local storage model to be used (@pxref{Thread-Local}).
The @var{model} argument should be one of @samp{global-dynamic},
@samp{local-dynamic}, @samp{initial-exec} or @samp{local-exec}.
Note that the choice is subject to optimization: the compiler may use
a more efficient model for symbols not visible outside of the translation
unit, or if @option{-fpic} is not given on the command line.

The default without @option{-fpic} is @samp{initial-exec}; with
@option{-fpic} the default is @samp{global-dynamic}.

@item -fvisibility=@r{[}default@r{|}internal@r{|}hidden@r{|}protected@r{]}
@opindex fvisibility
Set the default ELF image symbol visibility to the specified option---all
symbols are marked with this unless overridden within the code.
Using this feature can very substantially improve linking and
load times of shared object libraries, produce more optimized
code, provide near-perfect API export and prevent symbol clashes.
It is @strong{strongly} recommended that you use this in any shared objects
you distribute.

Despite the nomenclature, @samp{default} always means public; i.e.,
available to be linked against from outside the shared object.
@samp{protected} and @samp{internal} are pretty useless in real-world
usage so the only other commonly used option is @samp{hidden}.
The default if @option{-fvisibility} isn't specified is
@samp{default}, i.e., make every symbol public.

A good explanation of the benefits offered by ensuring ELF
symbols have the correct visibility is given by ``How To Write
Shared Libraries'' by Ulrich Drepper (which can be found at
@w{@uref{http://www.akkadia.org/drepper/}})---however a superior
solution made possible by this option to marking things hidden when
the default is public is to make the default hidden and mark things
public.  This is the norm with DLLs on Windows and with @option{-fvisibility=hidden}
and @code{__attribute__ ((visibility("default")))} instead of
@code{__declspec(dllexport)} you get almost identical semantics with
identical syntax.  This is a great boon to those working with
cross-platform projects.

For those adding visibility support to existing code, you may find
@code{#pragma GCC visibility} of use.  This works by you enclosing
the declarations you wish to set visibility for with (for example)
@code{#pragma GCC visibility push(hidden)} and
@code{#pragma GCC visibility pop}.
Bear in mind that symbol visibility should be viewed @strong{as
part of the API interface contract} and thus all new code should
always specify visibility when it is not the default; i.e., declarations
only for use within the local DSO should @strong{always} be marked explicitly
as hidden as so to avoid PLT indirection overheads---making this
abundantly clear also aids readability and self-documentation of the code.
Note that due to ISO C++ specification requirements, @code{operator new} and
@code{operator delete} must always be of default visibility.

Be aware that headers from outside your project, in particular system
headers and headers from any other library you use, may not be
expecting to be compiled with visibility other than the default.  You
may need to explicitly say @code{#pragma GCC visibility push(default)}
before including any such headers.

@code{extern} declarations are not affected by @option{-fvisibility}, so
a lot of code can be recompiled with @option{-fvisibility=hidden} with
no modifications.  However, this means that calls to @code{extern}
functions with no explicit visibility use the PLT, so it is more
effective to use @code{__attribute ((visibility))} and/or
@code{#pragma GCC visibility} to tell the compiler which @code{extern}
declarations should be treated as hidden.

Note that @option{-fvisibility} does affect C++ vague linkage
entities. This means that, for instance, an exception class that is
be thrown between DSOs must be explicitly marked with default
visibility so that the @samp{type_info} nodes are unified between
the DSOs.

An overview of these techniques, their benefits and how to use them
is at @uref{http://gcc.gnu.org/@/wiki/@/Visibility}.

@item -fstrict-volatile-bitfields
@opindex fstrict-volatile-bitfields
This option should be used if accesses to volatile bit-fields (or other
structure fields, although the compiler usually honors those types
anyway) should use a single access of the width of the
field's type, aligned to a natural alignment if possible.  For
example, targets with memory-mapped peripheral registers might require
all such accesses to be 16 bits wide; with this flag you can
declare all peripheral bit-fields as @code{unsigned short} (assuming short
is 16 bits on these targets) to force LLVM to use 16-bit accesses
instead of, perhaps, a more efficient 32-bit access.

If this option is disabled, the compiler uses the most efficient
instruction.  In the previous example, that might be a 32-bit load
instruction, even though that accesses bytes that do not contain
any portion of the bit-field, or memory-mapped registers unrelated to
the one being updated.

In some cases, such as when the @code{packed} attribute is applied to a
structure field, it may not be possible to access the field with a single
read or write that is correctly aligned for the target machine.  In this
case LLVM falls back to generating multiple accesses rather than code that
will fault or truncate the result at run time.

Note:  Due to restrictions of the C/C++11 memory model, write accesses are
not allowed to touch non bit-field members.  It is therefore recommended
to define all bits of the field's type as bit-field members.

The default value of this option is determined by the application binary
interface for the target processor.

@item -fsync-libcalls
@opindex fsync-libcalls
This option controls whether any out-of-line instance of the @code{__sync}
family of functions may be used to implement the C++11 @code{__atomic}
family of functions.

The default value of this option is enabled, thus the only useful form
of the option is @option{-fno-sync-libcalls}.  This option is used in
the implementation of the @file{libatomic} runtime library.

@end itemize

This section describes command-line options that are primarily of
interest to GCC developers, including options to support compiler
testing and investigation of compiler bugs and compile-time
performance problems.  This includes options that produce debug dumps
at various points in the compilation; that print statistics such as
memory use and execution time; and that print information about GCC's
configuration, such as where it searches for libraries.  You should
rarely need to use any of these options for ordinary compilation and
linking tasks.

@table @gcctabopt
@item -flto-report
@opindex flto-report
Prints a report with internal details on the workings of the link-time
optimizer.  The contents of this report vary from version to version.
It is meant to be useful to LLVM developers when processing object
files in LTO mode (via @option{-flto}).

Disabled by default.

@item -flto-report-wpa
@opindex flto-report-wpa
Like @option{-flto-report}, but only print for the WPA phase of Link
Time Optimization.

@item -print-file-name=@var{library}
@opindex print-file-name
Print the full absolute name of the library file @var{library} that
would be used when linking---and don't do anything else.  With this
option, LLVM does not compile or link anything; it just prints the
file name.

@item -print-multi-directory
@opindex print-multi-directory
Print the directory name corresponding to the multilib selected by any
other switches present in the command line.  This directory is supposed
to exist in @env{GCC_EXEC_PREFIX}.

@item -print-multi-lib
@opindex print-multi-lib
Print the mapping from multilib directory names to compiler switches
that enable them.  The directory name is separated from the switches by
@samp{;}, and each switch starts with an @samp{@@} instead of the
@samp{-}, without spaces between multiple switches.  This is supposed to
ease shell processing.

@item -print-multi-os-directory
@opindex print-multi-os-directory
Print the path to OS libraries for the selected
multilib, relative to some @file{lib} subdirectory.  If OS libraries are
present in the @file{lib} subdirectory and no multilibs are used, this is
usually just @file{.}, if OS libraries are present in @file{lib@var{suffix}}
sibling directories this prints e.g.@: @file{../lib64}, @file{../lib} or
@file{../lib32}, or if OS libraries are present in @file{lib/@var{subdir}}
subdirectories it prints e.g.@: @file{amd64}, @file{sparcv9} or @file{ev6}.

@item -print-prog-name=@var{program}
@opindex print-prog-name
Like @option{-print-file-name}, but searches for a program such as @command{cpp}.

@item -print-libgcc-file-name
@opindex print-libgcc-file-name
Same as @option{-print-file-name=libgcc.a}.

This is useful when you use @option{-nostdlib} or @option{-nodefaultlibs}
but you do want to link with @file{libgcc.a}.  You can do:

@smallexample
clang -nostdlib @var{files}@dots{} `gcc -print-libgcc-file-name`
@end smallexample

@item -print-search-dirs
@opindex print-search-dirs
Print the name of the configured installation directory and a list of
program and library directories @command{clang} searches---and don't do anything else.

This is useful when @command{clang} prints the error message
@samp{installation problem, cannot exec cpp0: No such file or directory}.
To resolve this you either need to put @file{cpp0} and the other compiler
components where @command{clang} expects to find them, or you can set the environment
variable @env{GCC_EXEC_PREFIX} to the directory where you installed them.
Don't forget the trailing @samp{/}.
@xref{Environment Variables}.

@item -dumpmachine
@opindex dumpmachine
Print the compiler's target machine (for example,
@samp{i686-pc-linux-gnu})---and don't do anything else.

@item -dumpversion
@opindex dumpversion
Print the compiler version (for example, @code{3.0})---and don't do
anything else.

@item -dumpspecs
@opindex dumpspecs
Print the compiler's built-in specs---and don't do anything else.  (This
is used when LLVM itself is being built.)

@item -frandom-seed=@var{number}
@opindex frandom-seed
This option provides a seed that LLVM uses in place of
random numbers in generating certain symbol names
that have to be different in every compiled file.  It is also used to
place unique stamps in coverage data files and the object files that
produce them.  You can use the @option{-frandom-seed} option to produce
reproducibly identical object files.

The @var{number} should be different for every file you compile.

@item -save-temps
@opindex save-temps
Store the usual ``temporary'' intermediate files permanently; place them
in the current directory and name them based on the source file.  Thus,
compiling @file{foo.c} with @option{-c -save-temps} produces files
@file{foo.i} and @file{foo.s}, as well as @file{foo.o}.  This creates a
preprocessed @file{foo.i} output file even though the compiler now
normally uses an integrated preprocessor.

When used in combination with the @option{-x} command-line option,
@option{-save-temps} is sensible enough to avoid over writing an
input source file with the same extension as an intermediate file.
The corresponding intermediate file may be obtained by renaming the
source file before using @option{-save-temps}.

If you invoke Clang/LLVM in parallel, compiling several different source
files that share a common base name in different subdirectories or the
same source file compiled for multiple output destinations, it is
likely that the different parallel compilers will interfere with each
other, and overwrite the temporary files.  For instance:

@smallexample
clang -save-temps -o outdir1/foo.o indir1/foo.c&
clang -save-temps -o outdir2/foo.o indir2/foo.c&
@end smallexample

may result in @file{foo.i} and @file{foo.o} being written to
simultaneously by both compilers.

@emph{Note:} The GCC variants of @option{-save-temps=cwd} and
@option{save-temps=obj} are not supported by Clang/LLVM.

@item -ftime-report
@opindex ftime-report

allocation for the WPA phase only.

@item -d@var{letters}
@itemx -fdump-rtl-@var{pass}
@itemx -fdump-rtl-@var{pass}=@var{filename}
@opindex d
@opindex fdump-rtl-@var{pass}
Says to make debugging dumps during compilation at times specified by
@var{letters}.  This is used for debugging the RTL-based passes of the
compiler.  The file names for most of the dumps are made by appending
a pass number and a word to the @var{dumpname}, and the files are
created in the directory of the output file.  In case of
@option{=@var{filename}} option, the dump is output on the given file
instead of the pass numbered dump files.  Note that the pass number is
assigned as passes are registered into the pass manager.  Most passes
are registered in the order that they will execute and for these passes
the number corresponds to the pass execution order.  However, passes
registered by plugins, passes specific to compilation targets, or
passes that are otherwise registered after all the other passes are
numbered higher than a pass named "final", even if they are executed
earlier.  @var{dumpname} is generated from the name of the output
file if explicitly specified and not an executable, otherwise it is
the basename of the source file.  These switches may have different
effects when @option{-E} is used for preprocessing.

Debug dumps can be enabled with a @option{-fdump-rtl} switch or some
@option{-d} option @var{letters}.  Here are the possible
letters for use in @var{pass} and @var{letters}, and their meanings:

@end table

@item -fdump-noaddr
@opindex fdump-noaddr

When doing debugging dumps, suppress instruction numbers and address output.
This makes it more feasible to use diff on debugging dumps for compiler
invocations with different options, in particular with and without
@option{-g}.

@item -fdump-unnumbered-links
@opindex fdump-unnumbered-links
When doing debugging dumps (see @option{-d} option above), suppress
instruction numbers for the links to the previous and next instructions
in a sequence.

@itemx -fdump-translation-unit-@var{options} @r{(C++ only)}
@opindex fdump-translation-unit
Dump a representation of the tree structure for the entire translation
unit to a file.  The file name is made by appending @file{.tu} to the
source file name, and the file is created in the same directory as the
output file.  If the @samp{-@var{options}} form is used, @var{options}
controls the details of the dump as described for the
@option{-fdump-tree} options.

@item -fdump-class-hierarchy @r{(C++ only)}
@itemx -fdump-class-hierarchy-@var{options} @r{(C++ only)}
@opindex fdump-class-hierarchy
Dump a representation of each class's hierarchy and virtual function
table layout to a file.  The file name is made by appending
@file{.class} to the source file name, and the file is created in the
same directory as the output file.  If the @samp{-@var{options}} form
is used, @var{options} controls the details of the dump as described
for the @option{-fdump-tree} options.

@item -fdump-ipa-@var{switch}
@opindex fdump-ipa
Control the dumping at various stages of inter-procedural analysis
language tree to a file.  The file name is generated by appending a
switch specific suffix to the source file name, and the file is created
in the same directory as the output file.  The following dumps are
possible:

@table @samp
@item all
Enables all inter-procedural analysis dumps.

@item cgraph
Dumps information about call-graph optimization, unused function removal,
and inlining decisions.

@item inline
Dump after function inlining.

@end table

Dump the list of optimization passes that are turned on and off by
the current command-line options.

@item -fdump-statistics-@var{option}
@opindex fdump-statistics
Enable and control dumping of pass statistics in a separate file.  The
file name is generated by appending a suffix ending in
@samp{.statistics} to the source file name, and the file is created in
the same directory as the output file.  If the @samp{-@var{option}}
form is used, @samp{-stats} causes counters to be summed over the
whole compilation unit while @samp{-details} dumps every event as
the passes generate them.  The default with no option is to sum
counters for each function compiled.

@item -fdump-tree-@var{switch}
@itemx -fdump-tree-@var{switch}-@var{options}
@itemx -fdump-tree-@var{switch}-@var{options}=@var{filename}
@opindex fdump-tree
Control the dumping at various stages of processing the intermediate
language tree to a file.  The file name is generated by appending a
switch-specific suffix to the source file name, and the file is
created in the same directory as the output file. In case of
@option{=@var{filename}} option, the dump is output on the given file
instead of the auto named dump files.  If the @samp{-@var{options}}
form is used, @var{options} is a list of @samp{-} separated options
which control the details of the dump.  Not all options are applicable
to all dumps; those that are not meaningful are ignored.  The
following options are available

@table @samp
@item address
Print the address of each node.  Usually this is not meaningful as it
changes according to the environment and source file.  Its primary use
is for tying up a dump file with a debug environment.
@item asmname
If @code{DECL_ASSEMBLER_NAME} has been set for a given decl, use that
in the dump instead of @code{DECL_NAME}.  Its primary use is ease of
use working backward from mangled names in the assembly file.
@item slim
When dumping front-end intermediate representations, inhibit dumping
of members of a scope or body of a function merely because that scope
has been reached.  Only dump such items when they are directly reachable
by some other path.

When dumping pretty-printed trees, this option inhibits dumping the
bodies of control structures.

When dumping RTL, print the RTL in slim (condensed) form instead of
the default LISP-like representation.
@item raw
Print a raw representation of the tree.  By default, trees are
pretty-printed into a C-like representation.
@item details
Enable more detailed dumps (not honored by every dump option). Also
include information from the optimization passes.
@item stats
Enable dumping various statistics about the pass (not honored by every dump
option).
@item blocks
Enable showing basic block boundaries (disabled in raw dumps).
@item graph
For each of the other indicated dump files (@option{-fdump-rtl-@var{pass}}),
dump a representation of the control flow graph suitable for viewing with
GraphViz to @file{@var{file}.@var{passid}.@var{pass}.dot}.  Each function in
the file is pretty-printed as a subgraph, so that GraphViz can render them
all in a single plot.

This option currently only works for RTL dumps, and the RTL is always
dumped in slim form.
@item vops
Enable showing virtual operands for every statement.
@item lineno
Enable showing line numbers for statements.
@item uid
Enable showing the unique ID (@code{DECL_UID}) for each variable.
@item verbose
Enable showing the tree dump for each statement.
@item eh
Enable showing the EH region number holding each statement.
@item scev
Enable showing scalar evolution analysis details.
@item optimized
Enable showing optimization information (only available in certain
passes).
@item missed
Enable showing missed optimization information (only available in certain
passes).
@item note
Enable other detailed optimization information (only available in
certain passes).
@item =@var{filename}
Instead of an auto named dump file, output into the given file
name. The file names @file{stdout} and @file{stderr} are treated
specially and are considered already open standard streams. For
example,

@smallexample
gcc -O2 -ftree-vectorize -fdump-tree-vect-blocks=foo.dump
     -fdump-tree-pre=stderr file.c
@end smallexample

outputs vectorizer dump into @file{foo.dump}, while the PRE dump is
output on to @file{stderr}. If two conflicting dump filenames are
given for the same pass, then the latter option overrides the earlier
one.

@item split-paths
@opindex fdump-tree-split-paths
Dump each function after splitting paths to loop backedges.  The file
name is made by appending @file{.split-paths} to the source file name.

@item all
Turn on all options, except @option{raw}, @option{slim}, @option{verbose}
and @option{lineno}.

@item optall
Turn on all optimization options, i.e., @option{optimized},
@option{missed}, and @option{note}.

@end table

@item -fopt-info
@itemx -fopt-info-@var{options}
@itemx -fopt-info-@var{options}=@var{filename}
@opindex fopt-info
Controls optimization dumps from various optimization passes. If the
@samp{-@var{options}} form is used, @var{options} is a list of
@samp{-} separated option keywords to select the dump details and
optimizations.

The @var{options} can be divided into two groups: options describing the
verbosity of the dump, and options describing which optimizations
should be included. The options from both the groups can be freely
mixed as they are non-overlapping. However, in case of any conflicts,
the later options override the earlier options on the command
line.

The following options control the dump verbosity:

@table @samp
@item optimized
Print information when an optimization is successfully applied. It is
up to a pass to decide which information is relevant. For example, the
vectorizer passes print the source location of loops which are
successfully vectorized.
@item missed
Print information about missed optimizations. Individual passes
control which information to include in the output.
@item note
Print verbose information about optimizations, such as certain
transformations, more detailed messages about decisions etc.
@item all
Print detailed optimization information. This includes
@samp{optimized}, @samp{missed}, and @samp{note}.
@end table

One or more of the following option keywords can be used to describe a
group of optimizations:

@table @samp
@item ipa
Enable dumps from all interprocedural optimizations.
@item loop
Enable dumps from all loop optimizations.
@item inline
Enable dumps from all inlining optimizations.
@item vec
Enable dumps from all vectorization optimizations.
@item optall
Enable dumps from all optimizations. This is a superset of
the optimization groups listed above.
@end table

If @var{options} is
omitted, it defaults to @samp{optimized-optall}, which means to dump all
info about successful optimizations from all the passes.

If the @var{filename} is provided, then the dumps from all the
applicable optimizations are concatenated into the @var{filename}.
Otherwise the dump is output onto @file{stderr}. Though multiple
@option{-fopt-info} options are accepted, only one of them can include
a @var{filename}. If other filenames are provided then all but the
first such option are ignored.

Note that the output @var{filename} is overwritten
in case of multiple translation units. If a combined output from
multiple translation units is desired, @file{stderr} should be used
instead.

In the following example, the optimization info is output to
@file{stderr}:

@smallexample
gcc -O3 -fopt-info
@end smallexample

This example:
@smallexample
gcc -O3 -fopt-info-missed=missed.all
@end smallexample

@noindent
outputs missed optimization report from all the passes into
@file{missed.all}, and this one:

@smallexample
gcc -O2 -ftree-vectorize -fopt-info-vec-missed
@end smallexample

@noindent
prints information about missed optimization opportunities from
vectorization passes on @file{stderr}.
Note that @option{-fopt-info-vec-missed} is equivalent to
@option{-fopt-info-missed-vec}.

As another example,
@smallexample
gcc -O3 -fopt-info-inline-optimized-missed=inline.txt
@end smallexample

@noindent
outputs information about missed optimizations as well as
optimized locations from all the inlining passes into
@file{inline.txt}.

Finally, consider:

@smallexample
gcc -fopt-info-vec-missed=vec.miss -fopt-info-loop-optimized=loop.opt
@end smallexample

@noindent
Here the two output filenames @file{vec.miss} and @file{loop.opt} are
in conflict since only one output file is allowed. In this case, only
the first option takes effect and the subsequent options are
ignored. Thus only @file{vec.miss} is produced which contains
dumps from the vectorizer about missed opportunities.

@item -fsched-verbose=@var{n}
@opindex fsched-verbose
On targets that use instruction scheduling, this option controls the
amount of debugging output the scheduler prints to the dump files.

For @var{n} greater than zero, @option{-fsched-verbose} outputs the
same information as @option{-fdump-rtl-sched1} and @option{-fdump-rtl-sched2}.
For @var{n} greater than one, it also output basic block probabilities,
detailed ready list information and unit/insn info.  For @var{n} greater
than two, it includes RTL at abort point, control-flow and regions info.
And for @var{n} over four, @option{-fsched-verbose} also includes
dependence info.



@item -fenable-@var{kind}-@var{pass}
@itemx -fdisable-@var{kind}-@var{pass}=@var{range-list}
@opindex fdisable-
@opindex fenable-

This is a set of options that are used to explicitly disable/enable
optimization passes.  These options are intended for use for debugging GCC.
Compiler users should use regular options for enabling/disabling
passes instead.

@table @gcctabopt

@item -fdisable-ipa-@var{pass}
Disable IPA pass @var{pass}. @var{pass} is the pass name.  If the same pass is
statically invoked in the compiler multiple times, the pass name should be
appended with a sequential number starting from 1.

@item -fdisable-rtl-@var{pass}
@itemx -fdisable-rtl-@var{pass}=@var{range-list}
Disable RTL pass @var{pass}.  @var{pass} is the pass name.  If the same pass is
statically invoked in the compiler multiple times, the pass name should be
appended with a sequential number starting from 1.  @var{range-list} is a
comma-separated list of function ranges or assembler names.  Each range is a number
pair separated by a colon.  The range is inclusive in both ends.  If the range
is trivial, the number pair can be simplified as a single number.  If the
function's call graph node's @var{uid} falls within one of the specified ranges,
the @var{pass} is disabled for that function.  The @var{uid} is shown in the
function header of a dump file, and the pass names can be dumped by using
option @option{-fdump-passes}.

@item -fdisable-tree-@var{pass}
@itemx -fdisable-tree-@var{pass}=@var{range-list}
Disable tree pass @var{pass}.  See @option{-fdisable-rtl} for the description of
option arguments.

@item -fenable-ipa-@var{pass}
Enable IPA pass @var{pass}.  @var{pass} is the pass name.  If the same pass is
statically invoked in the compiler multiple times, the pass name should be
appended with a sequential number starting from 1.

@item -fenable-rtl-@var{pass}
@itemx -fenable-rtl-@var{pass}=@var{range-list}
Enable RTL pass @var{pass}.  See @option{-fdisable-rtl} for option argument
description and examples.

@item -fenable-tree-@var{pass}
@itemx -fenable-tree-@var{pass}=@var{range-list}
Enable tree pass @var{pass}.  See @option{-fdisable-rtl} for the description
of option arguments.

# enable tree full unroll
   -fenable-tree-unroll

@end smallexample

@item -fchecking
@opindex fchecking
@opindex fno-checking
Enable internal consistency checking.  The default depends on
the compiler configuration.

@item -frandom-seed=@var{string}
@opindex frandom-seed
This option provides a seed that GCC uses in place of
random numbers in generating certain symbol names
that have to be different in every compiled file.  It is also used to
place unique stamps in coverage data files and the object files that
produce them.  You can use the @option{-frandom-seed} option to produce
reproducibly identical object files.

The @var{string} can either be a number (decimal, octal or hex) or an
arbitrary string (in which case it's converted to a number by
computing CRC32).

The @var{string} should be different for every file you compile.

@item -save-temps
@itemx -save-temps=cwd
@opindex save-temps
Store the usual ``temporary'' intermediate files permanently; place them
in the current directory and name them based on the source file.  Thus,
compiling @file{foo.c} with @option{-c -save-temps} produces files
@file{foo.i} and @file{foo.s}, as well as @file{foo.o}.  This creates a
preprocessed @file{foo.i} output file even though the compiler now
normally uses an integrated preprocessor.

When used in combination with the @option{-x} command-line option,
@option{-save-temps} is sensible enough to avoid over writing an
input source file with the same extension as an intermediate file.
The corresponding intermediate file may be obtained by renaming the
source file before using @option{-save-temps}.

If you invoke GCC in parallel, compiling several different source
files that share a common base name in different subdirectories or the
same source file compiled for multiple output destinations, it is
likely that the different parallel compilers will interfere with each
other, and overwrite the temporary files.  For instance:

@smallexample
gcc -save-temps -o outdir1/foo.o indir1/foo.c&
gcc -save-temps -o outdir2/foo.o indir2/foo.c&
@end smallexample

may result in @file{foo.i} and @file{foo.o} being written to
simultaneously by both compilers.

@item -save-temps=obj
@opindex save-temps=obj
Store the usual ``temporary'' intermediate files permanently.  If the
@option{-o} option is used, the temporary files are based on the
object file.  If the @option{-o} option is not used, the
@option{-save-temps=obj} switch behaves like @option{-save-temps}.

For example:

@smallexample
gcc -save-temps=obj -c foo.c
gcc -save-temps=obj -c bar.c -o dir/xbar.o
gcc -save-temps=obj foobar.c -o dir2/yfoobar
@end smallexample

@noindent
creates @file{foo.i}, @file{foo.s}, @file{dir/xbar.i},
@file{dir/xbar.s}, @file{dir2/yfoobar.i}, @file{dir2/yfoobar.s}, and
@file{dir2/yfoobar.o}.

@item -time@r{[}=@var{file}@r{]}
@opindex time
Report the CPU time taken by each subprocess in the compilation
sequence.  For C source files, this is the compiler proper and assembler
(plus the linker if linking is done).

Without the specification of an output file, the output looks like this:

@smallexample
# cc1 0.12 0.01
# as 0.00 0.01
@end smallexample

The first number on each line is the ``user time'', that is time spent
executing the program itself.  The second number is ``system time'',
time spent executing operating system routines on behalf of the program.
Both numbers are in seconds.

With the specification of an output file, the output is appended to the
named file, and it looks like this:

@smallexample
0.12 0.01 cc1 @var{options}
0.00 0.01 as @var{options}
@end smallexample

The ``user time'' and the ``system time'' are moved before the program
name, and the options passed to the program are displayed, so that one
can later tell what file was being compiled, and with which options.

@item -fdump-final-insns@r{[}=@var{file}@r{]}
@opindex fdump-final-insns
Dump the final internal representation (RTL) to @var{file}.  If the
optional argument is omitted (or if @var{file} is @code{.}), the name
of the dump file is determined by appending @code{.gkd} to the
compilation output file name.

@item -fcompare-debug@r{[}=@var{opts}@r{]}
@opindex fcompare-debug
@opindex fno-compare-debug
If no error occurs during compilation, run the compiler a second time,
adding @var{opts} and @option{-fcompare-debug-second} to the arguments
passed to the second compilation.  Dump the final internal
representation in both compilations, and print an error if they differ.

If the equal sign is omitted, the default @option{-gtoggle} is used.

The environment variable @env{GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG}, if defined, non-empty
and nonzero, implicitly enables @option{-fcompare-debug}.  If
@env{GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG} is defined to a string starting with a dash,
then it is used for @var{opts}, otherwise the default @option{-gtoggle}
is used.

@option{-fcompare-debug=}, with the equal sign but without @var{opts},
is equivalent to @option{-fno-compare-debug}, which disables the dumping
of the final representation and the second compilation, preventing even
@env{GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG} from taking effect.

To verify full coverage during @option{-fcompare-debug} testing, set
@env{GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG} to say @option{-fcompare-debug-not-overridden},
which GCC rejects as an invalid option in any actual compilation
(rather than preprocessing, assembly or linking).  To get just a
warning, setting @env{GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG} to @samp{-w%n-fcompare-debug
not overridden} will do.

@item -fcompare-debug-second
@opindex fcompare-debug-second
This option is implicitly passed to the compiler for the second
compilation requested by @option{-fcompare-debug}, along with options to
silence warnings, and omitting other options that would cause
side-effect compiler outputs to files or to the standard output.  Dump
files and preserved temporary files are renamed so as to contain the
@code{.gk} additional extension during the second compilation, to avoid
overwriting those generated by the first.

When this option is passed to the compiler driver, it causes the
@emph{first} compilation to be skipped, which makes it useful for little
other than debugging the compiler proper.

@item -gtoggle
@opindex gtoggle
Turn off generation of debug info, if leaving out this option
generates it, or turn it on at level 2 otherwise.  The position of this
argument in the command line does not matter; it takes effect after all
other options are processed, and it does so only once, no matter how
many times it is given.  This is mainly intended to be used with
@option{-fcompare-debug}.

@item -fvar-tracking-assignments-toggle
@opindex fvar-tracking-assignments-toggle
@opindex fno-var-tracking-assignments-toggle
Toggle @option{-fvar-tracking-assignments}, in the same way that
@option{-gtoggle} toggles @option{-g}.

@item -Q
@opindex Q
Makes the compiler print out each function name as it is compiled, and
print some statistics about each pass when it finishes.

@item -ftime-report
@opindex ftime-report
Makes the compiler print some statistics about the time consumed by each
pass when it finishes.

@item -fira-verbose=@var{n}
@opindex fira-verbose
Control the verbosity of the dump file for the integrated register allocator.
The default value is 5.  If the value @var{n} is greater or equal to 10,
the dump output is sent to stderr using the same format as @var{n} minus 10.

@item -flto-report
@opindex flto-report
Prints a report with internal details on the workings of the link-time
optimizer.  The contents of this report vary from version to version.
It is meant to be useful to GCC developers when processing object
files in LTO mode (via @option{-flto}).

Disabled by default.

@item -flto-report-wpa
@opindex flto-report-wpa
Like @option{-flto-report}, but only print for the WPA phase of Link
Time Optimization.

@item -fmem-report
@opindex fmem-report
Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent memory
allocation when it finishes.

@item -fmem-report-wpa
@opindex fmem-report-wpa
Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent memory
allocation for the WPA phase only.

@item -fpre-ipa-mem-report
@opindex fpre-ipa-mem-report
@item -fpost-ipa-mem-report
@opindex fpost-ipa-mem-report
Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent memory
allocation before or after interprocedural optimization.

@item -fprofile-report
@opindex fprofile-report
Makes the compiler print some statistics about consistency of the
(estimated) profile and effect of individual passes.

@item -fstack-usage
@opindex fstack-usage
Makes the compiler output stack usage information for the program, on a
per-function basis.  The filename for the dump is made by appending
@file{.su} to the @var{auxname}.  @var{auxname} is generated from the name of
the output file, if explicitly specified and it is not an executable,
otherwise it is the basename of the source file.  An entry is made up
of three fields:

@itemize
@item
The name of the function.
@item
A number of bytes.
@item
One or more qualifiers: @code{static}, @code{dynamic}, @code{bounded}.
@end itemize

The qualifier @code{static} means that the function manipulates the stack
statically: a fixed number of bytes are allocated for the frame on function
entry and released on function exit; no stack adjustments are otherwise made
in the function.  The second field is this fixed number of bytes.

The qualifier @code{dynamic} means that the function manipulates the stack
dynamically: in addition to the static allocation described above, stack
adjustments are made in the body of the function, for example to push/pop
arguments around function calls.  If the qualifier @code{bounded} is also
present, the amount of these adjustments is bounded at compile time and
the second field is an upper bound of the total amount of stack used by
the function.  If it is not present, the amount of these adjustments is
not bounded at compile time and the second field only represents the
bounded part.

@item -fstats
@opindex fstats
Emit statistics about front-end processing at the end of the compilation.
This option is supported only by the C++ front end, and
the information is generally only useful to the G++ development team.

@item -fdbg-cnt-list
@opindex fdbg-cnt-list
Print the name and the counter upper bound for all debug counters.


@item -fdbg-cnt=@var{counter-value-list}
@opindex fdbg-cnt
Set the internal debug counter upper bound.  @var{counter-value-list}
is a comma-separated list of @var{name}:@var{value} pairs
which sets the upper bound of each debug counter @var{name} to @var{value}.
All debug counters have the initial upper bound of @code{UINT_MAX};
thus @code{dbg_cnt} returns true always unless the upper bound
is set by this option.
For example, with @option{-fdbg-cnt=dce:10,tail_call:0},
@code{dbg_cnt(dce)} returns true only for first 10 invocations.

@item -print-file-name=@var{library}
@opindex print-file-name
Print the full absolute name of the library file @var{library} that
would be used when linking---and don't do anything else.  With this
option, GCC does not compile or link anything; it just prints the
file name.

@item -print-multi-directory
@opindex print-multi-directory
Print the directory name corresponding to the multilib selected by any
other switches present in the command line.  This directory is supposed
to exist in @env{GCC_EXEC_PREFIX}.

@item -print-multi-lib
@opindex print-multi-lib
Print the mapping from multilib directory names to compiler switches
that enable them.  The directory name is separated from the switches by
@samp{;}, and each switch starts with an @samp{@@} instead of the
@samp{-}, without spaces between multiple switches.  This is supposed to
ease shell processing.

@item -print-multi-os-directory
@opindex print-multi-os-directory
Print the path to OS libraries for the selected
multilib, relative to some @file{lib} subdirectory.  If OS libraries are
present in the @file{lib} subdirectory and no multilibs are used, this is
usually just @file{.}, if OS libraries are present in @file{lib@var{suffix}}
sibling directories this prints e.g.@: @file{../lib64}, @file{../lib} or
@file{../lib32}, or if OS libraries are present in @file{lib/@var{subdir}}
subdirectories it prints e.g.@: @file{amd64}, @file{sparcv9} or @file{ev6}.

@item -print-multiarch
@opindex print-multiarch
Print the path to OS libraries for the selected multiarch,
relative to some @file{lib} subdirectory.

@item -print-prog-name=@var{program}
@opindex print-prog-name
Like @option{-print-file-name}, but searches for a program such as @command{cpp}.

@item -print-libgcc-file-name
@opindex print-libgcc-file-name
Same as @option{-print-file-name=libgcc.a}.

This is useful when you use @option{-nostdlib} or @option{-nodefaultlibs}
but you do want to link with @file{libgcc.a}.  You can do:

@smallexample
gcc -nostdlib @var{files}@dots{} `gcc -print-libgcc-file-name`
@end smallexample

@item -print-search-dirs
@opindex print-search-dirs
Print the name of the configured installation directory and a list of
program and library directories @command{gcc} searches---and don't do anything else.

This is useful when @command{gcc} prints the error message
@samp{installation problem, cannot exec cpp0: No such file or directory}.
To resolve this you either need to put @file{cpp0} and the other compiler
components where @command{gcc} expects to find them, or you can set the environment
variable @env{GCC_EXEC_PREFIX} to the directory where you installed them.
Don't forget the trailing @samp{/}.
@xref{Environment Variables}.

@item -print-sysroot
@opindex print-sysroot
Print the target sysroot directory that is used during
compilation.  This is the target sysroot specified either at configure
time or using the @option{--sysroot} option, possibly with an extra
suffix that depends on compilation options.  If no target sysroot is
specified, the option prints nothing.

@item -print-sysroot-headers-suffix
@opindex print-sysroot-headers-suffix
Print the suffix added to the target sysroot when searching for
headers, or give an error if the compiler is not configured with such
a suffix---and don't do anything else.

@item -dumpmachine
@opindex dumpmachine
Print the compiler's target machine (for example,
@samp{i686-pc-linux-gnu})---and don't do anything else.

@item -dumpversion
@opindex dumpversion
Print the compiler version (for example, @code{3.0})---and don't do
anything else.

@item -dumpspecs
@opindex dumpspecs
Print the compiler's built-in specs---and don't do anything else.  (This
is used when GCC itself is being built.)

@node AArch64 Options
@subsection AArch64 Options
@cindex AArch64 Options

These options are defined for AArch64 implementations:

@table @gcctabopt

@item -mabi=@var{name}
@opindex mabi
Generate code for the specified data model.  Permissible values
are @samp{ilp32} for SysV-like data model where int, long int and pointer
are 32-bit, and @samp{lp64} for SysV-like data model where int is 32-bit,
but long int and pointer are 64-bit.

The default depends on the specific target configuration.  Note that
the LP64 and ILP32 ABIs are not link-compatible; you must compile your
entire program with the same ABI, and link with a compatible set of libraries.

@item -mbig-endian
@opindex mbig-endian
Generate big-endian code.  This is the default when LLVM is configured for an
@samp{aarch64_be-*-*} target.

@item -mgeneral-regs-only
@opindex mgeneral-regs-only
Generate code which uses only the general registers.

@item -mlittle-endian
@opindex mlittle-endian
Generate little-endian code.  This is the default when LLVM is configured for an
@samp{aarch64-*-*} but not an @samp{aarch64_be-*-*} target.

@item -mcmodel=tiny
@opindex mcmodel=tiny
Generate code for the tiny code model.  The program and its statically defined
symbols must be within 1GB of each other.  Pointers are 64 bits.  Programs can
be statically or dynamically linked.  This model is not fully implemented and
mostly treated as @samp{small}.

@item -mcmodel=small
@opindex mcmodel=small
Generate code for the small code model.  The program and its statically defined
symbols must be within 4GB of each other.  Pointers are 64 bits.  Programs can
be statically or dynamically linked.  This is the default code model.

@item -mcmodel=large
@opindex mcmodel=large
Generate code for the large code model.  This makes no assumptions about
addresses and sizes of sections.  Pointers are 64 bits.  Programs can be
statically linked only.

@item -mstrict-align
@opindex mstrict-align
Do not assume that unaligned memory references are handled by the system.

@item -momit-leaf-frame-pointer
@itemx -mno-omit-leaf-frame-pointer
@opindex momit-leaf-frame-pointer
@opindex mno-omit-leaf-frame-pointer
Omit or keep the frame pointer in leaf functions.  The former behaviour is the
default.

@item -mtls-dialect=desc
@opindex mtls-dialect=desc
Use TLS descriptors as the thread-local storage mechanism for dynamic accesses
of TLS variables.  This is the default.

@item -mtls-dialect=traditional
@opindex mtls-dialect=traditional
Use traditional TLS as the thread-local storage mechanism for dynamic accesses
of TLS variables.

@item -mfix-cortex-a53-835769
@itemx -mno-fix-cortex-a53-835769
@opindex mfix-cortex-a53-835769
@opindex mno-fix-cortex-a53-835769
Enable or disable the workaround for the ARM Cortex-A53 erratum number 835769.
This involves inserting a NOP instruction between memory instructions and
64-bit integer multiply-accumulate instructions.

@item -march=@var{name}
@opindex march
Specify the name of the target architecture, optionally suffixed by one or
more feature modifiers.  This option has the form
@option{-march=@var{arch}@r{@{}+@r{[}no@r{]}@var{feature}@r{@}*}}, where the
only permissible value for @var{arch} is @samp{armv8-a}.  The permissible
values for @var{feature} are documented in the sub-section below.

Where conflicting feature modifiers are specified, the right-most feature is
used.

LLVM uses this name to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when
generating assembly code.

Where @option{-march} is specified without either of @option{-mtune}
or @option{-mcpu} also being specified, the code is tuned to perform
well across a range of target processors implementing the target
architecture.

@item -mtune=@var{name}
@opindex mtune
Specify the name of the target processor for which LLVM should tune the
performance of the code.  Permissible values for this option are:
@samp{generic}, @samp{cortex-a53}, @samp{cortex-a57},
@samp{cortex-a72}, @samp{thunderx}, @samp{xgene1}.

Additionally, this option can specify that LLVM should tune the performance
of the code for a big.LITTLE system.  Permissible values for this
option are: @samp{cortex-a57.cortex-a53}, @samp{cortex-a72.cortex-a53}.

Where none of @option{-mtune=}, @option{-mcpu=} or @option{-march=}
are specified, the code is tuned to perform well across a range
of target processors.

This option cannot be suffixed by feature modifiers.

@item -mcpu=@var{name}
@opindex mcpu
Specify the name of the target processor, optionally suffixed by one or more
feature modifiers.  This option has the form
@option{-mcpu=@var{cpu}@r{@{}+@r{[}no@r{]}@var{feature}@r{@}*}}, where the
permissible values for @var{cpu} are the same as those available for
@option{-mtune}.

The permissible values for @var{feature} are documented in the sub-section
below.

Where conflicting feature modifiers are specified, the right-most feature is
used.

LLVM uses this name to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when
generating assembly code (as if by @option{-march}) and to determine
the target processor for which to tune for performance (as if
by @option{-mtune}).  Where this option is used in conjunction
with @option{-march} or @option{-mtune}, those options take precedence
over the appropriate part of this option.

@node Environment Variables
@section Environment Variables Affecting LLVM
@cindex environment variables

@c man begin ENVIRONMENT
This section describes several environment variables that affect how LLVM
operates.  Some of them work by specifying directories or prefixes to use
when searching for various kinds of files.  Some are used to specify other
aspects of the compilation environment.

Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as
@option{-B}, @option{-I} and @option{-L} (@pxref{Directory Options}).  These
take precedence over places specified using environment variables, which
in turn take precedence over those specified by the configuration of LLVM@.
@xref{Driver,, Controlling the Compilation Driver @file{gcc}, gccint,
GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) Internals}.

@table @env
@item LANG
@itemx LC_CTYPE
@c @itemx LC_COLLATE
@itemx LC_MESSAGES
@c @itemx LC_MONETARY
@c @itemx LC_NUMERIC
@c @itemx LC_TIME
@itemx LC_ALL
@findex LANG
@findex LC_CTYPE
@c @findex LC_COLLATE
@findex LC_MESSAGES
@c @findex LC_MONETARY
@c @findex LC_NUMERIC
@c @findex LC_TIME
@findex LC_ALL
@cindex locale
These environment variables control the way that LLVM uses
localization information which allows LLVM to work with different
national conventions.  LLVM inspects the locale categories
@env{LC_CTYPE} and @env{LC_MESSAGES} if it has been configured to do
so.  These locale categories can be set to any value supported by your
installation.  A typical value is @samp{en_GB.UTF-8} for English in the United
Kingdom encoded in UTF-8.

The @env{LC_CTYPE} environment variable specifies character
classification.  LLVM uses it to determine the character boundaries in
a string; this is needed for some multibyte encodings that contain quote
and escape characters that are otherwise interpreted as a string
end or escape.

The @env{LC_MESSAGES} environment variable specifies the language to
use in diagnostic messages.

If the @env{LC_ALL} environment variable is set, it overrides the value
of @env{LC_CTYPE} and @env{LC_MESSAGES}; otherwise, @env{LC_CTYPE}
and @env{LC_MESSAGES} default to the value of the @env{LANG}
environment variable.  If none of these variables are set, LLVM
defaults to traditional C English behavior.

@item TMPDIR
@findex TMPDIR
If @env{TMPDIR} is set, it specifies the directory to use for temporary
files.  LLVM uses temporary files to hold the output of one stage of
compilation which is to be used as input to the next stage: for example,
the output of the preprocessor, which is the input to the compiler
proper.

@item GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG
@findex GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG
Setting @env{GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG} is nearly equivalent to passing
@option{-fcompare-debug} to the compiler driver.  See the documentation
of this option for more details.

@item GCC_EXEC_PREFIX
@findex GCC_EXEC_PREFIX
If @env{GCC_EXEC_PREFIX} is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the
names of the subprograms executed by the compiler.  No slash is added
when this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram, but you can
specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.

If @env{GCC_EXEC_PREFIX} is not set, LLVM attempts to figure out
an appropriate prefix to use based on the pathname it is invoked with.

If LLVM cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it
tries looking in the usual places for the subprogram.

The default value of @env{GCC_EXEC_PREFIX} is
@file{@var{prefix}/lib/gcc/} where @var{prefix} is the prefix to
the installed compiler. In many cases @var{prefix} is the value
of @code{prefix} when you ran the @file{configure} script.

Other prefixes specified with @option{-B} take precedence over this prefix.

This prefix is also used for finding files such as @file{crt0.o} that are
used for linking.

In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding the
directories to search for header files.  For each of the standard
directories whose name normally begins with @samp{/usr/local/lib/gcc}
(more precisely, with the value of @env{GCC_INCLUDE_DIR}), LLVM tries
replacing that beginning with the specified prefix to produce an
alternate directory name.  Thus, with @option{-Bfoo/}, LLVM searches
@file{foo/bar} just before it searches the standard directory
@file{/usr/local/lib/bar}.
If a standard directory begins with the configured
@var{prefix} then the value of @var{prefix} is replaced by
@env{GCC_EXEC_PREFIX} when looking for header files.

@item COMPILER_PATH
@findex COMPILER_PATH
The value of @env{COMPILER_PATH} is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like @env{PATH}.  LLVM tries the directories thus
specified when searching for subprograms, if it can't find the
subprograms using @env{GCC_EXEC_PREFIX}.

@item LIBRARY_PATH
@findex LIBRARY_PATH
The value of @env{LIBRARY_PATH} is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like @env{PATH}.  When configured as a native compiler,
LLVM tries the directories thus specified when searching for special
linker files, if it can't find them using @env{GCC_EXEC_PREFIX}.  Linking
using LLVM also uses these directories when searching for ordinary
libraries for the @option{-l} option (but directories specified with
@option{-L} come first).

@item LANG
@findex LANG
@cindex locale definition
This variable is used to pass locale information to the compiler.  One way in
which this information is used is to determine the character set to be used
when character literals, string literals and comments are parsed in C and C++.
When the compiler is configured to allow multibyte characters,
the following values for @env{LANG} are recognized:

@table @samp
@item C-JIS
Recognize JIS characters.
@item C-SJIS
Recognize SJIS characters.
@item C-EUCJP
Recognize EUCJP characters.
@end table

If @env{LANG} is not defined, or if it has some other value, then the
compiler uses @code{mblen} and @code{mbtowc} as defined by the default locale to
recognize and translate multibyte characters.
@end table

@noindent
Some additional environment variables affect the behavior of the
preprocessor.

@vtable @env
@item CPATH
@itemx C_INCLUDE_PATH
@itemx CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
@itemx OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH
@c Commented out until ObjC++ is part of LLVM:
@c @itemx OBJCPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by a special
character, much like @env{PATH}, in which to look for header files.
The special character, @code{PATH_SEPARATOR}, is target-dependent and
determined at LLVM build time.  For Microsoft Windows-based targets it is a
semicolon, and for almost all other targets it is a colon.

@env{CPATH} specifies a list of directories to be searched as if
specified with @option{-I}, but after any paths given with @option{-I}
options on the command line.  This environment variable is used
regardless of which language is being preprocessed.

The remaining environment variables apply only when preprocessing the
particular language indicated.  Each specifies a list of directories
to be searched as if specified with @option{-isystem}, but after any
paths given with @option{-isystem} options on the command line.

In all these variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to
search its current working directory.  Empty elements can appear at the
beginning or end of a path.  For instance, if the value of
@env{CPATH} is @code{:/special/include}, that has the same
effect as @samp{@w{-I. -I/special/include}}.

@c man end
@c man begin ENVIRONMENT

@item DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT
@cindex dependencies for make as output
If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output
dependencies for Make based on the non-system header files processed
by the compiler.  System header files are ignored in the dependency
output.

The value of @env{DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT} can be just a file name, in
which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the target
name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the form
@samp{@var{file} @var{target}}, in which case the rules are written to
file @var{file} using @var{target} as the target name.

In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to combining
the options @option{-MM} and @option{-MF} (@pxref{Preprocessor
Options}), with an optional @option{-MT} switch too.

@item SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES
@cindex dependencies for make as output
This variable is the same as @env{DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT} (see above),
except that system header files are not ignored, so it implies
@option{-M} rather than @option{-MM}.  However, the dependence on the
main input file is omitted.  @xref{Preprocessor Options}.
@end vtable

@c man end

@node Precompiled Headers
@section Using Precompiled Headers
@cindex precompiled headers
@cindex speed of compilation

Often large projects have many header files that are included in every
source file.  The time the compiler takes to process these header files
over and over again can account for nearly all of the time required to
build the project.  To make builds faster, LLVM allows you to
@dfn{precompile} a header file.

To create a precompiled header file, simply compile it as you would any
other file, if necessary using the @option{-x} option to make the driver
treat it as a C or C++ header file.  You may want to use a
tool like @command{make} to keep the precompiled header up-to-date when
the headers it contains change.

A precompiled header file is searched for when @code{#include} is
seen in the compilation.  As it searches for the included file
(@pxref{Search Path,,Search Path,cpp,The C Preprocessor}) the
compiler looks for a precompiled header in each directory just before it
looks for the include file in that directory.  The name searched for is
the name specified in the @code{#include} with @samp{.gch} appended.  If
the precompiled header file can't be used, it is ignored.

For instance, if you have @code{#include "all.h"}, and you have
@file{all.h.gch} in the same directory as @file{all.h}, then the
precompiled header file is used if possible, and the original
header is used otherwise.

Alternatively, you might decide to put the precompiled header file in a
directory and use @option{-I} to ensure that directory is searched
before (or instead of) the directory containing the original header.
Then, if you want to check that the precompiled header file is always
used, you can put a file of the same name as the original header in this
directory containing an @code{#error} command.

This also works with @option{-include}.  So yet another way to use
precompiled headers, good for projects not designed with precompiled
header files in mind, is to simply take most of the header files used by
a project, include them from another header file, precompile that header
file, and @option{-include} the precompiled header.  If the header files
have guards against multiple inclusion, they are skipped because
they've already been included (in the precompiled header).

If you need to precompile the same header file for different
languages, targets, or compiler options, you can instead make a
@emph{directory} named like @file{all.h.gch}, and put each precompiled
header in the directory, perhaps using @option{-o}.  It doesn't matter
what you call the files in the directory; every precompiled header in
the directory is considered.  The first precompiled header
encountered in the directory that is valid for this compilation is
used; they're searched in no particular order.

There are many other possibilities, limited only by your imagination,
good sense, and the constraints of your build system.

A precompiled header file can be used only when these conditions apply:

@itemize
@item
Only one precompiled header can be used in a particular compilation.

@item
A precompiled header can't be used once the first C token is seen.  You
can have preprocessor directives before a precompiled header; you cannot
include a precompiled header from inside another header.

@item
The precompiled header file must be produced for the same language as
the current compilation.  You can't use a C precompiled header for a C++
compilation.

@item
The precompiled header file must have been produced by the same compiler
binary as the current compilation is using.

@item
Any macros defined before the precompiled header is included must
either be defined in the same way as when the precompiled header was
generated, or must not affect the precompiled header, which usually
means that they don't appear in the precompiled header at all.

The @option{-D} option is one way to define a macro before a
precompiled header is included; using a @code{#define} can also do it.
There are also some options that define macros implicitly, like
@option{-O} and @option{-Wdeprecated}; the same rule applies to macros
defined this way.

@item If debugging information is output when using the precompiled
header, using @option{-g} or similar, the same kind of debugging information
must have been output when building the precompiled header.  However,
a precompiled header built using @option{-g} can be used in a compilation
when no debugging information is being output.

@item The same @option{-m} options must generally be used when building
and using the precompiled header.  @xref{Submodel Options},
for any cases where this rule is relaxed.

@item Each of the following options must be the same when building and using
the precompiled header:

@gccoptlist{-fexceptions}

@item
Some other command-line options starting with @option{-f},
@option{-p}, or @option{-O} must be defined in the same way as when
the precompiled header was generated.  At present, it's not clear
which options are safe to change and which are not; the safest choice
is to use exactly the same options when generating and using the
precompiled header.  The following are known to be safe:

@gccoptlist{-fmessage-length=  -fpreprocessed  -fsched-interblock @gol
-fsched-spec  -fsched-spec-load  -fsched-spec-load-dangerous @gol
-fsched-verbose=@var{number}  -fschedule-insns  -fvisibility= @gol
-pedantic-errors}

@end itemize

For all of these except the last, the compiler automatically
ignores the precompiled header if the conditions aren't met.  If you
find an option combination that doesn't work and doesn't cause the
precompiled header to be ignored, please consider filing a bug report,
see @ref{Bugs}.

If you do use differing options when generating and using the
precompiled header, the actual behavior is a mixture of the
behavior for the options.  For instance, if you use @option{-g} to
generate the precompiled header but not when using it, you may or may
not get debugging information for routines in the precompiled header.
