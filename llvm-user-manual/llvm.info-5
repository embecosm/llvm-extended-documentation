6.58.21 PowerPC Hardware Transactional Memory Built-in Functions
----------------------------------------------------------------

GCC provides two interfaces for accessing the Hardware Transactional
Memory (HTM) instructions available on some of the PowerPC family of
processors (eg, POWER8).  The two interfaces come in a low level
interface, consisting of built-in functions specific to PowerPC and a
higher level interface consisting of inline functions that are common
between PowerPC and S/390.

6.58.21.1 PowerPC HTM Low Level Built-in Functions
..................................................

The following low level built-in functions are available with '-mhtm' or
'-mcpu=CPU' where CPU is 'power8' or later.  They all generate the
machine instruction that is part of the name.

 The HTM built-ins return true or false depending on their success and
their arguments match exactly the type and order of the associated
hardware instruction's operands.  Refer to the ISA manual for a
description of each instruction's operands.

     unsigned int __builtin_tbegin (unsigned int)
     unsigned int __builtin_tend (unsigned int)

     unsigned int __builtin_tabort (unsigned int)
     unsigned int __builtin_tabortdc (unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned int)
     unsigned int __builtin_tabortdci (unsigned int, unsigned int, int)
     unsigned int __builtin_tabortwc (unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned int)
     unsigned int __builtin_tabortwci (unsigned int, unsigned int, int)

     unsigned int __builtin_tcheck (unsigned int)
     unsigned int __builtin_treclaim (unsigned int)
     unsigned int __builtin_trechkpt (void)
     unsigned int __builtin_tsr (unsigned int)

 In addition to the above HTM built-ins, we have added built-ins for
some common extended mnemonics of the HTM instructions:

     unsigned int __builtin_tendall (void)
     unsigned int __builtin_tresume (void)
     unsigned int __builtin_tsuspend (void)

 The following set of built-in functions are available to gain access to
the HTM specific special purpose registers.

     unsigned long __builtin_get_texasr (void)
     unsigned long __builtin_get_texasru (void)
     unsigned long __builtin_get_tfhar (void)
     unsigned long __builtin_get_tfiar (void)

     void __builtin_set_texasr (unsigned long);
     void __builtin_set_texasru (unsigned long);
     void __builtin_set_tfhar (unsigned long);
     void __builtin_set_tfiar (unsigned long);

 Example usage of these low level built-in functions may look like:

     #include <htmintrin.h>

     int num_retries = 10;

     while (1)
       {
         if (__builtin_tbegin (0))
           {
             /* Transaction State Initiated.  */
             if (is_locked (lock))
               __builtin_tabort (0);
             ... transaction code...
             __builtin_tend (0);
             break;
           }
         else
           {
             /* Transaction State Failed.  Use locks if the transaction
                failure is "persistent" or we've tried too many times.  */
             if (num_retries-- <= 0
                 || _TEXASRU_FAILURE_PERSISTENT (__builtin_get_texasru ()))
               {
                 acquire_lock (lock);
                 ... non transactional fallback path...
                 release_lock (lock);
                 break;
               }
           }
       }

 One final built-in function has been added that returns the value of
the 2-bit Transaction State field of the Machine Status Register (MSR)
as stored in 'CR0'.

     unsigned long __builtin_ttest (void)

 This built-in can be used to determine the current transaction state
using the following code example:

     #include <htmintrin.h>

     unsigned char tx_state = _HTM_STATE (__builtin_ttest ());

     if (tx_state == _HTM_TRANSACTIONAL)
       {
         /* Code to use in transactional state.  */
       }
     else if (tx_state == _HTM_NONTRANSACTIONAL)
       {
         /* Code to use in non-transactional state.  */
       }
     else if (tx_state == _HTM_SUSPENDED)
       {
         /* Code to use in transaction suspended state.  */
       }

6.58.21.2 PowerPC HTM High Level Inline Functions
.................................................

The following high level HTM interface is made available by including
'<htmxlintrin.h>' and using '-mhtm' or '-mcpu=CPU' where CPU is 'power8'
or later.  This interface is common between PowerPC and S/390, allowing
users to write one HTM source implementation that can be compiled and
executed on either system.

     long __TM_simple_begin (void)
     long __TM_begin (void* const TM_buff)
     long __TM_end (void)
     void __TM_abort (void)
     void __TM_named_abort (unsigned char const code)
     void __TM_resume (void)
     void __TM_suspend (void)

     long __TM_is_user_abort (void* const TM_buff)
     long __TM_is_named_user_abort (void* const TM_buff, unsigned char *code)
     long __TM_is_illegal (void* const TM_buff)
     long __TM_is_footprint_exceeded (void* const TM_buff)
     long __TM_nesting_depth (void* const TM_buff)
     long __TM_is_nested_too_deep(void* const TM_buff)
     long __TM_is_conflict(void* const TM_buff)
     long __TM_is_failure_persistent(void* const TM_buff)
     long __TM_failure_address(void* const TM_buff)
     long long __TM_failure_code(void* const TM_buff)

 Using these common set of HTM inline functions, we can create a more
portable version of the HTM example in the previous section that will
work on either PowerPC or S/390:

     #include <htmxlintrin.h>

     int num_retries = 10;
     TM_buff_type TM_buff;

     while (1)
       {
         if (__TM_begin (TM_buff))
           {
             /* Transaction State Initiated.  */
             if (is_locked (lock))
               __TM_abort ();
             ... transaction code...
             __TM_end ();
             break;
           }
         else
           {
             /* Transaction State Failed.  Use locks if the transaction
                failure is "persistent" or we've tried too many times.  */
             if (num_retries-- <= 0
                 || __TM_is_failure_persistent (TM_buff))
               {
                 acquire_lock (lock);
                 ... non transactional fallback path...
                 release_lock (lock);
                 break;
               }
           }
       }

6.58.23 S/390 System z Built-in Functions
-----------------------------------------

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_tbegin (void*)
     Generates the 'tbegin' machine instruction starting a
     non-constraint hardware transaction.  If the parameter is non-NULL
     the memory area is used to store the transaction diagnostic buffer
     and will be passed as first operand to 'tbegin'.  This buffer can
     be defined using the 'struct __htm_tdb' C struct defined in
     'htmintrin.h' and must reside on a double-word boundary.  The
     second tbegin operand is set to '0xff0c'.  This enables
     save/restore of all GPRs and disables aborts for FPR and AR
     manipulations inside the transaction body.  The condition code set
     by the tbegin instruction is returned as integer value.  The tbegin
     instruction by definition overwrites the content of all FPRs.  The
     compiler will generate code which saves and restores the FPRs.  For
     soft-float code it is recommended to used the '*_nofloat' variant.
     In order to prevent a TDB from being written it is required to pass
     an constant zero value as parameter.  Passing the zero value
     through a variable is not sufficient.  Although modifications of
     access registers inside the transaction will not trigger an
     transaction abort it is not supported to actually modify them.
     Access registers do not get saved when entering a transaction.
     They will have undefined state when reaching the abort code.

 Macros for the possible return codes of tbegin are defined in the
'htmintrin.h' header file:

'_HTM_TBEGIN_STARTED'
     'tbegin' has been executed as part of normal processing.  The
     transaction body is supposed to be executed.
'_HTM_TBEGIN_INDETERMINATE'
     The transaction was aborted due to an indeterminate condition which
     might be persistent.
'_HTM_TBEGIN_TRANSIENT'
     The transaction aborted due to a transient failure.  The
     transaction should be re-executed in that case.
'_HTM_TBEGIN_PERSISTENT'
     The transaction aborted due to a persistent failure.  Re-execution
     under same circumstances will not be productive.

 -- Macro: _HTM_FIRST_USER_ABORT_CODE
     The '_HTM_FIRST_USER_ABORT_CODE' defined in 'htmintrin.h' specifies
     the first abort code which can be used for '__builtin_tabort'.
     Values below this threshold are reserved for machine use.

 -- Data type: struct __htm_tdb
     The 'struct __htm_tdb' defined in 'htmintrin.h' describes the
     structure of the transaction diagnostic block as specified in the
     Principles of Operation manual chapter 5-91.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_tbegin_nofloat (void*)
     Same as '__builtin_tbegin' but without FPR saves and restores.
     Using this variant in code making use of FPRs will leave the FPRs
     in undefined state when entering the transaction abort handler
     code.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_tbegin_retry (void*, int)
     In addition to '__builtin_tbegin' a loop for transient failures is
     generated.  If tbegin returns a condition code of 2 the transaction
     will be retried as often as specified in the second argument.  The
     perform processor assist instruction is used to tell the CPU about
     the number of fails so far.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_tbegin_retry_nofloat (void*, int)
     Same as '__builtin_tbegin_retry' but without FPR saves and
     restores.  Using this variant in code making use of FPRs will leave
     the FPRs in undefined state when entering the transaction abort
     handler code.

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_tbeginc (void)
     Generates the 'tbeginc' machine instruction starting a constraint
     hardware transaction.  The second operand is set to '0xff08'.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_tend (void)
     Generates the 'tend' machine instruction finishing a transaction
     and making the changes visible to other threads.  The condition
     code generated by tend is returned as integer value.

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_tabort (int)
     Generates the 'tabort' machine instruction with the specified abort
     code.  Abort codes from 0 through 255 are reserved and will result
     in an error message.

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_tx_assist (int)
     Generates the 'ppa rX,rY,1' machine instruction.  Where the integer
     parameter is loaded into rX and a value of zero is loaded into rY.
     The integer parameter specifies the number of times the transaction
     repeatedly aborted.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_tx_nesting_depth (void)
     Generates the 'etnd' machine instruction.  The current nesting
     depth is returned as integer value.  For a nesting depth of 0 the
     code is not executed as part of an transaction.

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_non_tx_store (uint64_t *,
          uint64_t)

     Generates the 'ntstg' machine instruction.  The second argument is
     written to the first arguments location.  The store operation will
     not be rolled-back in case of an transaction abort.


File: llvm.info,  Node: SH Built-in Functions,  Next: SPARC VIS Built-in Functions,  Prev: S/390 System z Built-in Functions,  Up: Target Builtins

6.58.24 SH Built-in Functions
-----------------------------

The following built-in functions are supported on the SH1, SH2, SH3 and
SH4 families of processors:

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_set_thread_pointer (void *PTR)
     Sets the 'GBR' register to the specified value PTR.  This is
     usually used by system code that manages threads and execution
     contexts.  The compiler normally does not generate code that
     modifies the contents of 'GBR' and thus the value is preserved
     across function calls.  Changing the 'GBR' value in user code must
     be done with caution, since the compiler might use 'GBR' in order
     to access thread local variables.

 -- Built-in Function: void * __builtin_thread_pointer (void)
     Returns the value that is currently set in the 'GBR' register.
     Memory loads and stores that use the thread pointer as a base
     address are turned into 'GBR' based displacement loads and stores,
     if possible.  For example:
          struct my_tcb
          {
             int a, b, c, d, e;
          };

          int get_tcb_value (void)
          {
            // Generate 'mov.l @(8,gbr),r0' instruction
            return ((my_tcb*)__builtin_thread_pointer ())->c;
          }


 -- Built-in Function: unsigned int __builtin_sh_get_fpscr (void)
     Returns the value that is currently set in the 'FPSCR' register.

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_sh_set_fpscr (unsigned int VAL)
     Sets the 'FPSCR' register to the specified value VAL, while
     preserving the current values of the FR, SZ and PR bits.

6.58.25 SPARC VIS Built-in Functions
------------------------------------

GCC supports SIMD operations on the SPARC using both the generic vector
extensions (*note Vector Extensions::) as well as built-in functions for
the SPARC Visual Instruction Set (VIS). When you use the '-mvis' switch,
the VIS extension is exposed as the following built-in functions:

     typedef int v1si __attribute__ ((vector_size (4)));
     typedef int v2si __attribute__ ((vector_size (8)));
     typedef short v4hi __attribute__ ((vector_size (8)));

6.58.26 SPU Built-in Functions
------------------------------

GCC provides extensions for the SPU processor as described in the
Sony/Toshiba/IBM SPU Language Extensions Specification, which can be
found at <http://cell.scei.co.jp/> or
<http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/power/cell/>.  GCC's implementation
differs in several ways.

   * The optional extension of specifying vector constants in
     parentheses is not supported.

   * A vector initializer requires no cast if the vector constant is of
     the same type as the variable it is initializing.

   * If 'signed' or 'unsigned' is omitted, the signedness of the vector
     type is the default signedness of the base type.  The default
     varies depending on the operating system, so a portable program
     should always specify the signedness.

   * By default, the keyword '__vector' is added.  The macro 'vector' is
     defined in '<spu_intrinsics.h>' and can be undefined.

   * GCC allows using a 'typedef' name as the type specifier for a
     vector type.

   * For C, overloaded functions are implemented with macros so the
     following does not work:

            spu_add ((vector signed int){1, 2, 3, 4}, foo);

     Since 'spu_add' is a macro, the vector constant in the example is
     treated as four separate arguments.  Wrap the entire argument in
     parentheses for this to work.

   * The extended version of '__builtin_expect' is not supported.

 _Note:_ Only the interface described in the aforementioned
specification is supported.  Internally, GCC uses built-in functions to
implement the required functionality, but these are not supported and
are subject to change without notice.

6.58.30 x86 Built-in Functions
------------------------------

These built-in functions are available for the x86-32 and x86-64 family
of computers, depending on the command-line switches used.

 If you specify command-line switches such as '-msse', the compiler
could use the extended instruction sets even if the built-ins are not
used explicitly in the program.  For this reason, applications that
perform run-time CPU detection must compile separate files for each
supported architecture, using the appropriate flags.  In particular, the
file containing the CPU detection code should be compiled without these
options.

 The following machine modes are available for use with MMX built-in
functions (*note Vector Extensions::): 'V2SI' for a vector of two 32-bit
integers, 'V4HI' for a vector of four 16-bit integers, and 'V8QI' for a
vector of eight 8-bit integers.  Some of the built-in functions operate
on MMX registers as a whole 64-bit entity, these use 'V1DI' as their
mode.

 If 3DNow! extensions are enabled, 'V2SF' is used as a mode for a vector
of two 32-bit floating-point values.

 If SSE extensions are enabled, 'V4SF' is used for a vector of four
32-bit floating-point values.  Some instructions use a vector of four
32-bit integers, these use 'V4SI'.  Finally, some instructions operate
on an entire vector register, interpreting it as a 128-bit integer,
these use mode 'TI'.

 In 64-bit mode, the x86-64 family of processors uses additional
built-in functions for efficient use of 'TF' ('__float128') 128-bit
floating point and 'TC' 128-bit complex floating-point values.

 The following floating-point built-in functions are available in 64-bit
mode.  All of them implement the function that is part of the name.

     __float128 __builtin_fabsq (__float128)
     __float128 __builtin_copysignq (__float128, __float128)

 The following built-in function is always available.

'void __builtin_ia32_pause (void)'
     Generates the 'pause' machine instruction with a compiler memory
     barrier.

 The following floating-point built-in functions are made available in
the 64-bit mode.

'__float128 __builtin_infq (void)'
     Similar to '__builtin_inf', except the return type is '__float128'.

'__float128 __builtin_huge_valq (void)'
     Similar to '__builtin_huge_val', except the return type is
     '__float128'.

 The following built-in functions are always available and can be used
to check the target platform type.

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_cpu_init (void)
     This function runs the CPU detection code to check the type of CPU
     and the features supported.  This built-in function needs to be
     invoked along with the built-in functions to check CPU type and
     features, '__builtin_cpu_is' and '__builtin_cpu_supports', only
     when used in a function that is executed before any constructors
     are called.  The CPU detection code is automatically executed in a
     very high priority constructor.

     For example, this function has to be used in 'ifunc' resolvers that
     check for CPU type using the built-in functions '__builtin_cpu_is'
     and '__builtin_cpu_supports', or in constructors on targets that
     don't support constructor priority.

          static void (*resolve_memcpy (void)) (void)
          {
            // ifunc resolvers fire before constructors, explicitly call the init
            // function.
            __builtin_cpu_init ();
            if (__builtin_cpu_supports ("ssse3"))
              return ssse3_memcpy; // super fast memcpy with ssse3 instructions.
            else
              return default_memcpy;
          }

          void *memcpy (void *, const void *, size_t)
               __attribute__ ((ifunc ("resolve_memcpy")));

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_cpu_is (const char *CPUNAME)
     This function returns a positive integer if the run-time CPU is of
     type CPUNAME and returns '0' otherwise.  The following CPU names
     can be detected:

     'intel'
          Intel CPU.

     'atom'
          Intel Atom CPU.

     'core2'
          Intel Core 2 CPU.

     'corei7'

     'shanghai'
          AMD Family 10h Shanghai CPU.

     'istanbul'
          AMD Family 10h Istanbul CPU.

     'btver1'
          AMD Family 14h CPU.

     'amdfam15h'
          AMD Family 15h CPU.

     'bdver1'
          AMD Family 15h Bulldozer version 1.

     'bdver2'
          AMD Family 15h Bulldozer version 2.

     'bdver3'
          AMD Family 15h Bulldozer version 3.

     'bdver4'
          AMD Family 15h Bulldozer version 4.

     'btver2'
          AMD Family 16h CPU.

     Here is an example:
          if (__builtin_cpu_is ("corei7"))
            {
               do_corei7 (); // Core i7 specific implementation.
            }
          else
            {
               do_generic (); // Generic implementation.
            }

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_cpu_supports (const char *FEATURE)
     This function returns a positive integer if the run-time CPU
     supports FEATURE and returns '0' otherwise.  The following features
     can be detected:

     'cmov'
          CMOV instruction.
     'mmx'
          MMX instructions.
     'popcnt'
          POPCNT instruction.

          SSE3 instructions.
     'ssse3'
          SSSE3 instructions.

          AVX instructions.
     'avx2'
          AVX2 instructions.
     'avx512f'
          AVX512F instructions.

     Here is an example:
          if (__builtin_cpu_supports ("popcnt"))
            {
               asm("popcnt %1,%0" : "=r"(count) : "rm"(n) : "cc");
            }
          else
            {
               count = generic_countbits (n); //generic implementation.
            }

File: llvm.info,  Node: x86 transactional memory intrinsics,  Prev: x86 Built-in Functions,  Up: Target Builtins

6.58.31 x86 Transactional Memory Intrinsics
-------------------------------------------

These hardware transactional memory intrinsics for x86 allow you to use
memory transactions with RTM (Restricted Transactional Memory).  This
support is enabled with the '-mrtm' option.  For using HLE (Hardware
Lock Elision) see *note x86 specific memory model extensions for
transactional memory:: instead.

 A memory transaction commits all changes to memory in an atomic way, as
visible to other threads.  If the transaction fails it is rolled back
and all side effects discarded.

 Generally there is no guarantee that a memory transaction ever succeeds
and suitable fallback code always needs to be supplied.

 -- RTM Function: unsigned _xbegin ()
     Start a RTM (Restricted Transactional Memory) transaction.  Returns
     '_XBEGIN_STARTED' when the transaction started successfully (note
     this is not 0, so the constant has to be explicitly tested).

     If the transaction aborts, all side-effects are undone and an abort
     code encoded as a bit mask is returned.  The following macros are
     defined:

     '_XABORT_EXPLICIT'
          Transaction was explicitly aborted with '_xabort'.  The
          parameter passed to '_xabort' is available with
          '_XABORT_CODE(status)'.
     '_XABORT_RETRY'
          Transaction retry is possible.
     '_XABORT_CONFLICT'
          Transaction abort due to a memory conflict with another
          thread.
     '_XABORT_CAPACITY'
          Transaction abort due to the transaction using too much
          memory.
     '_XABORT_DEBUG'
          Transaction abort due to a debug trap.
     '_XABORT_NESTED'
          Transaction abort in an inner nested transaction.

     There is no guarantee any transaction ever succeeds, so there
     always needs to be a valid fallback path.

 -- RTM Function: void _xend ()
     Commit the current transaction.  When no transaction is active this
     faults.  All memory side-effects of the transaction become visible
     to other threads in an atomic manner.

 -- RTM Function: int _xtest ()
     Return a nonzero value if a transaction is currently active,
     otherwise 0.

 -- RTM Function: void _xabort (status)
     Abort the current transaction.  When no transaction is active this
     is a no-op.  The STATUS is an 8-bit constant; its value is encoded
     in the return value from '_xbegin'.

 Here is an example showing handling for '_XABORT_RETRY' and a fallback
path for other failures:

     #include <immintrin.h>

     int n_tries, max_tries;
     unsigned status = _XABORT_EXPLICIT;
     ...

     for (n_tries = 0; n_tries < max_tries; n_tries++)
       {
         status = _xbegin ();
         if (status == _XBEGIN_STARTED || !(status & _XABORT_RETRY))
           break;
       }
     if (status == _XBEGIN_STARTED)
       {
         ... transaction code...
         _xend ();
       }
     else
       {
         ... non-transactional fallback path...
       }

Note that, in most cases, the transactional and non-transactional code
must synchronize together to ensure consistency.

6.59 Format Checks Specific to Particular Target Machines
=========================================================

For some target machines, GCC supports additional options to the format
attribute (*note Declaring Attributes of Functions: Function
Attributes.).

* Menu:

* Solaris Format Checks::
* Darwin Format Checks::


File: llvm.info,  Node: Solaris Format Checks,  Next: Darwin Format Checks,  Up: Target Format Checks

6.59.1 Solaris Format Checks
----------------------------

Solaris targets support the 'cmn_err' (or '__cmn_err__') format check.
'cmn_err' accepts a subset of the standard 'printf' conversions, and the
two-argument '%b' conversion for displaying bit-fields.  See the Solaris
man page for 'cmn_err' for more information.


File: llvm.info,  Node: Darwin Format Checks,  Prev: Solaris Format Checks,  Up: Target Format Checks

6.59.2 Darwin Format Checks
---------------------------

Darwin targets support the 'CFString' (or '__CFString__') in the format
attribute context.  Declarations made with such attribution are parsed
for correct syntax and format argument types.  However, parsing of the
format string itself is currently undefined and is not carried out by
this version of the compiler.

 Additionally, 'CFStringRefs' (defined by the 'CoreFoundation' headers)
may also be used as format arguments.  Note that the relevant headers
are only likely to be available on Darwin (OSX) installations.  On such
installations, the XCode and system documentation provide descriptions
of 'CFString', 'CFStringRefs' and associated functions.

6.60 Pragmas Accepted by GCC
============================

GCC supports several types of pragmas, primarily in order to compile
code originally written for other compilers.  Note that in general we do
not recommend the use of pragmas; *Note Function Attributes::, for
further explanation.

* Menu:

* ARM Pragmas::
* M32C Pragmas::

* RS/6000 and PowerPC Pragmas::

* Loop-Specific Pragmas::


File: llvm.info,  Node: ARM Pragmas,  Next: M32C Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

6.60.1 ARM Pragmas
------------------

The ARM target defines pragmas for controlling the default addition of
'long_call' and 'short_call' attributes to functions.  *Note Function
Attributes::, for information about the effects of these attributes.

'long_calls'
     Set all subsequent functions to have the 'long_call' attribute.

'no_long_calls'
     Set all subsequent functions to have the 'short_call' attribute.

'long_calls_off'
     Do not affect the 'long_call' or 'short_call' attributes of
     subsequent functions.


File: llvm.info,  Node: M32C Pragmas,  Next: MeP Pragmas,  Prev: ARM Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

6.60.2 M32C Pragmas
-------------------

'GCC memregs NUMBER'
     Overrides the command-line option '-memregs=' for the current file.
     Use with care!  This pragma must be before any function in the
     file, and mixing different memregs values in different objects may
     make them incompatible.  This pragma is useful when a
     performance-critical function uses a memreg for temporary values,
     as it may allow you to reduce the number of memregs used.

'ADDRESS NAME ADDRESS'
     For any declared symbols matching NAME, this does three things to
     that symbol: it forces the symbol to be located at the given
     address (a number), it forces the symbol to be volatile, and it
     changes the symbol's scope to be static.  This pragma exists for
     compatibility with other compilers, but note that the common
     '1234H' numeric syntax is not supported (use '0x1234' instead).
     Example:

          #pragma ADDRESS port3 0x103
          char port3;


File: llvm.info,  Node: MeP Pragmas,  Next: RS/6000 and PowerPC Pragmas,  Prev: M32C Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

6.60.3 MeP Pragmas
------------------

'custom io_volatile (on|off)'
     Overrides the command-line option '-mio-volatile' for the current
     file.  Note that for compatibility with future GCC releases, this
     option should only be used once before any 'io' variables in each
     file.

'GCC coprocessor available REGISTERS'
     Specifies which coprocessor registers are available to the register
     allocator.  REGISTERS may be a single register, register range
     separated by ellipses, or comma-separated list of those.  Example:

          #pragma GCC coprocessor available $c0...$c10, $c28

'GCC coprocessor call_saved REGISTERS'
     Specifies which coprocessor registers are to be saved and restored
     by any function using them.  REGISTERS may be a single register,
     register range separated by ellipses, or comma-separated list of
     those.  Example:

          #pragma GCC coprocessor call_saved $c4...$c6, $c31

'GCC coprocessor subclass '(A|B|C|D)' = REGISTERS'
     Creates and defines a register class.  These register classes can
     be used by inline 'asm' constructs.  REGISTERS may be a single
     register, register range separated by ellipses, or comma-separated
     list of those.  Example:

          #pragma GCC coprocessor subclass 'B' = $c2, $c4, $c6

          asm ("cpfoo %0" : "=B" (x));

'GCC disinterrupt NAME , NAME ...'
     For the named functions, the compiler adds code to disable
     interrupts for the duration of those functions.  If any functions
     so named are not encountered in the source, a warning is emitted
     that the pragma is not used.  Examples:

          #pragma disinterrupt foo
          #pragma disinterrupt bar, grill
          int foo () { ... }

'GCC call NAME , NAME ...'
     For the named functions, the compiler always uses a
     register-indirect call model when calling the named functions.
     Examples:

          extern int foo ();
          #pragma call foo

6.60.4 RS/6000 and PowerPC Pragmas
----------------------------------

The RS/6000 and PowerPC targets define one pragma for controlling
whether or not the 'longcall' attribute is added to function
declarations by default.  This pragma overrides the '-mlongcall' option,
but not the 'longcall' and 'shortcall' attributes.  *Note RS/6000 and
PowerPC Options::, for more information about when long calls are and
are not necessary.

'longcall (1)'
     Apply the 'longcall' attribute to all subsequent function
     declarations.

'longcall (0)'
     Do not apply the 'longcall' attribute to subsequent function
     declarations.


File: llvm.info,  Node: Darwin Pragmas,  Next: Solaris Pragmas,  Prev: RS/6000 and PowerPC Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

6.60.5 Darwin Pragmas
---------------------

The following pragmas are available for all architectures running the
Darwin operating system.  These are useful for compatibility with other
Mac OS compilers.

'mark TOKENS...'
     This pragma is accepted, but has no effect.

'options align=ALIGNMENT'
     This pragma sets the alignment of fields in structures.  The values
     of ALIGNMENT may be 'mac68k', to emulate m68k alignment, or
     'power', to emulate PowerPC alignment.  Uses of this pragma nest
     properly; to restore the previous setting, use 'reset' for the
     ALIGNMENT.

'segment TOKENS...'
     This pragma is accepted, but has no effect.

'unused (VAR [, VAR]...)'
     This pragma declares variables to be possibly unused.  GCC does not
     produce warnings for the listed variables.  The effect is similar
     to that of the 'unused' attribute, except that this pragma may
     appear anywhere within the variables' scopes.


File: llvm.info,  Node: Solaris Pragmas,  Next: Symbol-Renaming Pragmas,  Prev: Darwin Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

6.60.6 Solaris Pragmas
----------------------

The Solaris target supports '#pragma redefine_extname' (*note
Symbol-Renaming Pragmas::).  It also supports additional '#pragma'
directives for compatibility with the system compiler.

'align ALIGNMENT (VARIABLE [, VARIABLE]...)'

     Increase the minimum alignment of each VARIABLE to ALIGNMENT.  This
     is the same as GCC's 'aligned' attribute *note Variable
     Attributes::).  Macro expansion occurs on the arguments to this
     pragma when compiling C and Objective-C.  It does not currently
     occur when compiling C++, but this is a bug which may be fixed in a
     future release.

'fini (FUNCTION [, FUNCTION]...)'

     This pragma causes each listed FUNCTION to be called after main, or
     during shared module unloading, by adding a call to the '.fini'
     section.

'init (FUNCTION [, FUNCTION]...)'

     This pragma causes each listed FUNCTION to be called during
     initialization (before 'main') or during shared module loading, by
     adding a call to the '.init' section.


File: llvm.info,  Node: Symbol-Renaming Pragmas,  Next: Structure-Packing Pragmas,  Prev: Solaris Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

6.60.7 Symbol-Renaming Pragmas
------------------------------

GCC supports a '#pragma' directive that changes the name used in
assembly for a given declaration.  While this pragma is supported on all
platforms, it is intended primarily to provide compatibility with the
Solaris system headers.  This effect can also be achieved using the asm
labels extension (*note Asm Labels::).

'redefine_extname OLDNAME NEWNAME'

     This pragma gives the C function OLDNAME the assembly symbol
     NEWNAME.  The preprocessor macro '__PRAGMA_REDEFINE_EXTNAME' is
     defined if this pragma is available (currently on all platforms).

 This pragma and the asm labels extension interact in a complicated
manner.  Here are some corner cases you may want to be aware of:

  1. This pragma silently applies only to declarations with external
     linkage.  Asm labels do not have this restriction.

  2. In C++, this pragma silently applies only to declarations with "C"
     linkage.  Again, asm labels do not have this restriction.

  3. If either of the ways of changing the assembly name of a
     declaration are applied to a declaration whose assembly name has
     already been determined (either by a previous use of one of these
     features, or because the compiler needed the assembly name in order
     to generate code), and the new name is different, a warning issues
     and the name does not change.

  4. The OLDNAME used by '#pragma redefine_extname' is always the
     C-language name.


File: llvm.info,  Node: Structure-Packing Pragmas,  Next: Weak Pragmas,  Prev: Symbol-Renaming Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

6.60.8 Structure-Packing Pragmas
--------------------------------

For compatibility with Microsoft Windows compilers, GCC supports a set
of '#pragma' directives that change the maximum alignment of members of
structures (other than zero-width bit-fields), unions, and classes
subsequently defined.  The N value below always is required to be a
small power of two and specifies the new alignment in bytes.

  1. '#pragma pack(N)' simply sets the new alignment.
  2. '#pragma pack()' sets the alignment to the one that was in effect
     when compilation started (see also command-line option
     '-fpack-struct[=N]' *note Code Gen Options::).
  3. '#pragma pack(push[,N])' pushes the current alignment setting on an
     internal stack and then optionally sets the new alignment.
  4. '#pragma pack(pop)' restores the alignment setting to the one saved
     at the top of the internal stack (and removes that stack entry).
     Note that '#pragma pack([N])' does not influence this internal
     stack; thus it is possible to have '#pragma pack(push)' followed by
     multiple '#pragma pack(N)' instances and finalized by a single
     '#pragma pack(pop)'.

 Some targets, e.g. x86 and PowerPC, support the 'ms_struct' '#pragma'
which lays out a structure as the documented '__attribute__
((ms_struct))'.
  1. '#pragma ms_struct on' turns on the layout for structures declared.
  2. '#pragma ms_struct off' turns off the layout for structures
     declared.
  3. '#pragma ms_struct reset' goes back to the default layout.

6.60.9 Weak Pragmas
-------------------

For compatibility with SVR4, GCC supports a set of '#pragma' directives
for declaring symbols to be weak, and defining weak aliases.

'#pragma weak SYMBOL'
     This pragma declares SYMBOL to be weak, as if the declaration had
     the attribute of the same name.  The pragma may appear before or
     after the declaration of SYMBOL.  It is not an error for SYMBOL to
     never be defined at all.

'#pragma weak SYMBOL1 = SYMBOL2'
     This pragma declares SYMBOL1 to be a weak alias of SYMBOL2.  It is
     an error if SYMBOL2 is not defined in the current translation unit.


File: llvm.info,  Node: Diagnostic Pragmas,  Next: Visibility Pragmas,  Prev: Weak Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

6.60.10 Diagnostic Pragmas
--------------------------

GCC allows the user to selectively enable or disable certain types of
diagnostics, and change the kind of the diagnostic.  For example, a
project's policy might require that all sources compile with '-Werror'
but certain files might have exceptions allowing specific types of
warnings.  Or, a project might selectively enable diagnostics and treat
them as errors depending on which preprocessor macros are defined.

'#pragma GCC diagnostic KIND OPTION'

     Modifies the disposition of a diagnostic.  Note that not all
     diagnostics are modifiable; at the moment only warnings (normally
     controlled by '-W...') can be controlled, and not all of them.  Use
     '-fdiagnostics-show-option' to determine which diagnostics are
     controllable and which option controls them.

     KIND is 'error' to treat this diagnostic as an error, 'warning' to
     treat it like a warning (even if '-Werror' is in effect), or
     'ignored' if the diagnostic is to be ignored.  OPTION is a double
     quoted string that matches the command-line option.

          #pragma GCC diagnostic warning "-Wformat"
          #pragma GCC diagnostic error "-Wformat"
          #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wformat"

     Note that these pragmas override any command-line options.  GCC
     keeps track of the location of each pragma, and issues diagnostics
     according to the state as of that point in the source file.  Thus,
     pragmas occurring after a line do not affect diagnostics caused by
     that line.

'#pragma GCC diagnostic push'
'#pragma GCC diagnostic pop'

     Causes GCC to remember the state of the diagnostics as of each
     'push', and restore to that point at each 'pop'.  If a 'pop' has no
     matching 'push', the command-line options are restored.

          #pragma GCC diagnostic error "-Wuninitialized"
            foo(a);                       /* error is given for this one */
          #pragma GCC diagnostic push
          #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wuninitialized"
            foo(b);                       /* no diagnostic for this one */
          #pragma GCC diagnostic pop
            foo(c);                       /* error is given for this one */
          #pragma GCC diagnostic pop
            foo(d);                       /* depends on command-line options */

 GCC also offers a simple mechanism for printing messages during
compilation.

'#pragma message STRING'

     Prints STRING as a compiler message on compilation.  The message is
     informational only, and is neither a compilation warning nor an
     error.

          #pragma message "Compiling " __FILE__ "..."

     STRING may be parenthesized, and is printed with location
     information.  For example,

          #define DO_PRAGMA(x) _Pragma (#x)
          #define TODO(x) DO_PRAGMA(message ("TODO - " #x))

          TODO(Remember to fix this)

     prints '/tmp/file.c:4: note: #pragma message: TODO - Remember to
     fix this'.

6.60.11 Visibility Pragmas
--------------------------

'#pragma GCC visibility push(VISIBILITY)'
'#pragma GCC visibility pop'

     This pragma allows the user to set the visibility for multiple
     declarations without having to give each a visibility attribute
     (*note Function Attributes::).

     In C++, '#pragma GCC visibility' affects only namespace-scope
     declarations.  Class members and template specializations are not
     affected; if you want to override the visibility for a particular
     member or instantiation, you must use an attribute.

6.60.12 Push/Pop Macro Pragmas
------------------------------

For compatibility with Microsoft Windows compilers, GCC supports
'#pragma push_macro("MACRO_NAME")' and '#pragma
pop_macro("MACRO_NAME")'.

'#pragma push_macro("MACRO_NAME")'
     This pragma saves the value of the macro named as MACRO_NAME to the
     top of the stack for this macro.

'#pragma pop_macro("MACRO_NAME")'
     This pragma sets the value of the macro named as MACRO_NAME to the
     value on top of the stack for this macro.  If the stack for
     MACRO_NAME is empty, the value of the macro remains unchanged.

 For example:

     #define X  1
     #pragma push_macro("X")
     #undef X
     #define X -1
     #pragma pop_macro("X")
     int x [X];

In this example, the definition of X as 1 is saved by '#pragma
push_macro' and restored by '#pragma pop_macro'.

6.60.13 Function Specific Option Pragmas
----------------------------------------

'#pragma GCC target ("STRING"...)'

     This pragma allows you to set target specific options for functions
     defined later in the source file.  One or more strings can be
     specified.  Each function that is defined after this point is as if
     'attribute((target("STRING")))' was specified for that function.
     The parenthesis around the options is optional.  *Note Function
     Attributes::, for more information about the 'target' attribute and
     the attribute syntax.

     The '#pragma GCC target' pragma is presently implemented for x86,
     PowerPC, and Nios II targets only.

'#pragma GCC optimize ("STRING"...)'

     This pragma allows you to set global optimization options for
     functions defined later in the source file.  One or more strings
     can be specified.  Each function that is defined after this point
     is as if 'attribute((optimize("STRING")))' was specified for that
     function.  The parenthesis around the options is optional.  *Note
     Function Attributes::, for more information about the 'optimize'
     attribute and the attribute syntax.

'#pragma GCC push_options'
'#pragma GCC pop_options'

     These pragmas maintain a stack of the current target and
     optimization options.  It is intended for include files where you
     temporarily want to switch to using a different '#pragma GCC
     target' or '#pragma GCC optimize' and then to pop back to the
     previous options.

'#pragma GCC reset_options'

     This pragma clears the current '#pragma GCC target' and '#pragma
     GCC optimize' to use the default switches as specified on the
     command line.

6.60.14 Loop-Specific Pragmas
-----------------------------

'#pragma GCC ivdep'

 With this pragma, the programmer asserts that there are no loop-carried
dependencies which would prevent consecutive iterations of the following
loop from executing concurrently with SIMD (single instruction multiple
data) instructions.

 For example, the compiler can only unconditionally vectorize the
following loop with the pragma:

     void foo (int n, int *a, int *b, int *c)
     {
       int i, j;
     #pragma GCC ivdep
       for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
         a[i] = b[i] + c[i];
     }

In this example, using the 'restrict' qualifier had the same effect.  In
the following example, that would not be possible.  Assume k < -m or k
>= m.  Only with the pragma, the compiler knows that it can
unconditionally vectorize the following loop:

     void ignore_vec_dep (int *a, int k, int c, int m)
     {
     #pragma GCC ivdep
       for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
         a[i] = a[i + k] * c;
     }

6.61 Unnamed Structure and Union Fields
=======================================

As permitted by ISO C11 and for compatibility with other compilers, GCC
allows you to define a structure or union that contains, as fields,
structures and unions without names.  For example:

     struct {
       int a;
       union {
         int b;
         float c;
       };
       int d;
     } foo;

In this example, you are able to access members of the unnamed union
with code like 'foo.b'.  Note that only unnamed structs and unions are
allowed, you may not have, for example, an unnamed 'int'.

 You must never create such structures that cause ambiguous field
definitions.  For example, in this structure:

     struct {
       int a;
       struct {
         int a;
       };
     } foo;

it is ambiguous which 'a' is being referred to with 'foo.a'.  The
compiler gives errors for such constructs.

 Unless '-fms-extensions' is used, the unnamed field must be a structure
or union definition without a tag (for example, 'struct { int a; };').
If '-fms-extensions' is used, the field may also be a definition with a
tag such as 'struct foo { int a; };', a reference to a previously
defined structure or union such as 'struct foo;', or a reference to a
'typedef' name for a previously defined structure or union type.

 The option '-fplan9-extensions' enables '-fms-extensions' as well as
two other extensions.  First, a pointer to a structure is automatically
converted to a pointer to an anonymous field for assignments and
function calls.  For example:

     struct s1 { int a; };
     struct s2 { struct s1; };
     extern void f1 (struct s1 *);
     void f2 (struct s2 *p) { f1 (p); }

In the call to 'f1' inside 'f2', the pointer 'p' is converted into a
pointer to the anonymous field.

 Second, when the type of an anonymous field is a 'typedef' for a
'struct' or 'union', code may refer to the field using the name of the
'typedef'.

     typedef struct { int a; } s1;
     struct s2 { s1; };
     s1 f1 (struct s2 *p) { return p->s1; }

 These usages are only permitted when they are not ambiguous.

6.62 Thread-Local Storage
=========================

Thread-local storage (TLS) is a mechanism by which variables are
allocated such that there is one instance of the variable per extant
thread.  The runtime model GCC uses to implement this originates in the
IA-64 processor-specific ABI, but has since been migrated to other
processors as well.  It requires significant support from the linker
('ld'), dynamic linker ('ld.so'), and system libraries ('libc.so' and
'libpthread.so'), so it is not available everywhere.

 At the user level, the extension is visible with a new storage class
keyword: '__thread'.  For example:

     __thread int i;
     extern __thread struct state s;
     static __thread char *p;

 The '__thread' specifier may be used alone, with the 'extern' or
'static' specifiers, but with no other storage class specifier.  When
used with 'extern' or 'static', '__thread' must appear immediately after
the other storage class specifier.

 The '__thread' specifier may be applied to any global, file-scoped
static, function-scoped static, or static data member of a class.  It
may not be applied to block-scoped automatic or non-static data member.

 When the address-of operator is applied to a thread-local variable, it
is evaluated at run time and returns the address of the current thread's
instance of that variable.  An address so obtained may be used by any
thread.  When a thread terminates, any pointers to thread-local
variables in that thread become invalid.

 No static initialization may refer to the address of a thread-local
variable.

 In C++, if an initializer is present for a thread-local variable, it
must be a CONSTANT-EXPRESSION, as defined in 5.19.2 of the ANSI/ISO C++
standard.

 See ELF Handling For Thread-Local Storage
(http://www.akkadia.org/drepper/tls.pdf) for a detailed explanation of
the four thread-local storage addressing models, and how the runtime is
expected to function.

document the exact semantics of the language extension.

   * '5.1.2 Execution environments'

     Add new text after paragraph 1

          Within either execution environment, a "thread" is a flow of
          control within a program.  It is implementation defined
          whether or not there may be more than one thread associated
          with a program.  It is implementation defined how threads
          beyond the first are created, the name and type of the
          function called at thread startup, and how threads may be
          terminated.  However, objects with thread storage duration
          shall be initialized before thread startup.

   * '6.2.4 Storage durations of objects'

     Add new text before paragraph 3

          An object whose identifier is declared with the storage-class
          specifier '__thread' has "thread storage duration".  Its
          lifetime is the entire execution of the thread, and its stored
          value is initialized only once, prior to thread startup.

   * '6.4.1 Keywords'

     Add '__thread'.

   * '6.7.1 Storage-class specifiers'

     Add '__thread' to the list of storage class specifiers in paragraph
     1.

     Change paragraph 2 to

          With the exception of '__thread', at most one storage-class
          specifier may be given [...].  The '__thread' specifier may be
          used alone, or immediately following 'extern' or 'static'.

     Add new text after paragraph 6

          The declaration of an identifier for a variable that has block
          scope that specifies '__thread' shall also specify either
          'extern' or 'static'.

          The '__thread' specifier shall be used only with variables.

The following are a set of changes to ISO/IEC 14882:1998 (aka C++98)
that document the exact semantics of the language extension.

   * [intro.execution]

     New text after paragraph 4

          A "thread" is a flow of control within the abstract machine.
          It is implementation defined whether or not there may be more
          than one thread.

     New text after paragraph 7

          It is unspecified whether additional action must be taken to
          ensure when and whether side effects are visible to other
          threads.

   * [lex.key]

     Add '__thread'.

   * [basic.start.main]

     Add after paragraph 5

          The thread that begins execution at the 'main' function is
          called the "main thread".  It is implementation defined how
          functions beginning threads other than the main thread are
          designated or typed.  A function so designated, as well as the
          'main' function, is called a "thread startup function".  It is
          implementation defined what happens if a thread startup
          function returns.  It is implementation defined what happens
          to other threads when any thread calls 'exit'.

   * [basic.start.init]

     Add after paragraph 4

          The storage for an object of thread storage duration shall be
          statically initialized before the first statement of the
          thread startup function.  An object of thread storage duration
          shall not require dynamic initialization.

   * [basic.start.term]

     Add after paragraph 3

          The type of an object with thread storage duration shall not
          have a non-trivial destructor, nor shall it be an array type
          whose elements (directly or indirectly) have non-trivial
          destructors.

   * [basic.stc]

     Add "thread storage duration" to the list in paragraph 1.

     Change paragraph 2

          Thread, static, and automatic storage durations are associated
          with objects introduced by declarations [...].

     Add '__thread' to the list of specifiers in paragraph 3.

   * [basic.stc.thread]

     New section before [basic.stc.static]

          The keyword '__thread' applied to a non-local object gives the
          object thread storage duration.

          A local variable or class data member declared both 'static'
          and '__thread' gives the variable or member thread storage
          duration.

   * [basic.stc.static]

     Change paragraph 1

          All objects that have neither thread storage duration, dynamic
          storage duration nor are local [...].

   * [dcl.stc]

     Add '__thread' to the list in paragraph 1.

     Change paragraph 1

          With the exception of '__thread', at most one
          STORAGE-CLASS-SPECIFIER shall appear in a given
          DECL-SPECIFIER-SEQ.  The '__thread' specifier may be used
          alone, or immediately following the 'extern' or 'static'
          specifiers.  [...]

     Add after paragraph 5

          The '__thread' specifier can be applied only to the names of
          objects and to anonymous unions.

   * [class.mem]

     Add after paragraph 6

          Non-'static' members shall not be '__thread'.

6.63 Binary Constants using the '0b' Prefix
===========================================

Integer constants can be written as binary constants, consisting of a
sequence of '0' and '1' digits, prefixed by '0b' or '0B'.  This is
particularly useful in environments that operate a lot on the bit level
(like microcontrollers).

 The following statements are identical:

     i =       42;
     i =     0x2a;
     i =      052;
     i = 0b101010;

 The type of these constants follows the same rules as for octal or
hexadecimal integer constants, so suffixes like 'L' or 'UL' can be
applied.

programs: check for a predefined macro '__GNUC__'.  You can also use
'__GNUG__' to test specifically for GNU C++ (*note Predefined Macros:
(cpp)Common Predefined Macros.).

7.1 When is a Volatile C++ Object Accessed?
===========================================

The C++ standard differs from the C standard in its treatment of
volatile objects.  It fails to specify what constitutes a volatile
access, except to say that C++ should behave in a similar manner to C
with respect to volatiles, where possible.  However, the different
lvalueness of expressions between C and C++ complicate the behavior.
G++ behaves the same as GCC for volatile access, *Note Volatiles: C
Extensions, for a description of GCC's behavior.

 The C and C++ language specifications differ when an object is accessed
in a void context:

     volatile int *src = SOMEVALUE;
     *src;

 The C++ standard specifies that such expressions do not undergo lvalue
to rvalue conversion, and that the type of the dereferenced object may
be incomplete.  The C++ standard does not specify explicitly that it is
lvalue to rvalue conversion that is responsible for causing an access.
There is reason to believe that it is, because otherwise certain simple
expressions become undefined.  However, because it would surprise most
programmers, G++ treats dereferencing a pointer to volatile object of
complete type as GCC would do for an equivalent type in C.  When the
object has incomplete type, G++ issues a warning; if you wish to force
an error, you must force a conversion to rvalue with, for instance, a
static cast.

 When using a reference to volatile, G++ does not treat equivalent
expressions as accesses to volatiles, but instead issues a warning that
no volatile is accessed.  The rationale for this is that otherwise it
becomes difficult to determine where volatile access occur, and not
possible to ignore the return value from functions returning volatile
references.  Again, if you wish to force a read, cast the reference to
an rvalue.

 G++ implements the same behavior as GCC does when assigning to a
volatile object--there is no reread of the assigned-to object, the
assigned rvalue is reused.  Note that in C++ assignment expressions are
lvalues, and if used as an lvalue, the volatile object is referred to.
For instance, VREF refers to VOBJ, as expected, in the following
example:

     volatile int vobj;
     volatile int &vref = vobj = SOMETHING;


File: llvm.info,  Node: Restricted Pointers,  Next: Vague Linkage,  Prev: C++ Volatiles,  Up: C++ Extensions

7.2 Restricting Pointer Aliasing
================================

As with the C front end, G++ understands the C99 feature of restricted
pointers, specified with the '__restrict__', or '__restrict' type
qualifier.  Because you cannot compile C++ by specifying the '-std=c99'
language flag, 'restrict' is not a keyword in C++.

 In addition to allowing restricted pointers, you can specify restricted
references, which indicate that the reference is not aliased in the
local context.

     void fn (int *__restrict__ rptr, int &__restrict__ rref)
     {
       /* ... */
     }

In the body of 'fn', RPTR points to an unaliased integer and RREF refers
to a (different) unaliased integer.

 You may also specify whether a member function's THIS pointer is
unaliased by using '__restrict__' as a member function qualifier.

     void T::fn () __restrict__
     {
       /* ... */
     }

Within the body of 'T::fn', THIS has the effective definition 'T
*__restrict__ const this'.  Notice that the interpretation of a
'__restrict__' member function qualifier is different to that of 'const'
or 'volatile' qualifier, in that it is applied to the pointer rather
than the object.  This is consistent with other compilers that implement
restricted pointers.

 As with all outermost parameter qualifiers, '__restrict__' is ignored
in function definition matching.  This means you only need to specify
'__restrict__' in a function definition, rather than in a function
prototype as well.

7.3 Vague Linkage
=================

There are several constructs in C++ that require space in the object
file but are not clearly tied to a single translation unit.  We say that
these constructs have "vague linkage".  Typically such constructs are
emitted wherever they are needed, though sometimes we can be more
clever.

Inline Functions
     Inline functions are typically defined in a header file which can
     be included in many different compilations.  Hopefully they can
     usually be inlined, but sometimes an out-of-line copy is necessary,
     if the address of the function is taken or if inlining fails.  In
     general, we emit an out-of-line copy in all translation units where
     one is needed.  As an exception, we only emit inline virtual
     functions with the vtable, since it always requires a copy.

     Local static variables and string constants used in an inline
     function are also considered to have vague linkage, since they must
     be shared between all inlined and out-of-line instances of the
     function.

VTables
     C++ virtual functions are implemented in most compilers using a
     lookup table, known as a vtable.  The vtable contains pointers to
     the virtual functions provided by a class, and each object of the
     class contains a pointer to its vtable (or vtables, in some
     multiple-inheritance situations).  If the class declares any
     non-inline, non-pure virtual functions, the first one is chosen as
     the "key method" for the class, and the vtable is only emitted in
     the translation unit where the key method is defined.

     _Note:_ If the chosen key method is later defined as inline, the
     vtable is still emitted in every translation unit that defines it.
     Make sure that any inline virtuals are declared inline in the class
     body, even if they are not defined there.

'type_info' objects
     C++ requires information about types to be written out in order to
     implement 'dynamic_cast', 'typeid' and exception handling.  For
     polymorphic classes (classes with virtual functions), the
     'type_info' object is written out along with the vtable so that
     'dynamic_cast' can determine the dynamic type of a class object at
     run time.  For all other types, we write out the 'type_info' object
     when it is used: when applying 'typeid' to an expression, throwing
     an object, or referring to a type in a catch clause or exception
     specification.

Template Instantiations
     Most everything in this section also applies to template
     instantiations, but there are other options as well.  *Note Where's
     the Template?: Template Instantiation.

 When used with GNU ld version 2.8 or later on an ELF system such as
GNU/Linux or Solaris 2, or on Microsoft Windows, duplicate copies of
these constructs will be discarded at link time.  This is known as
COMDAT support.

 On targets that don't support COMDAT, but do support weak symbols, GCC
uses them.  This way one copy overrides all the others, but the unused
copies still take up space in the executable.

 For targets that do not support either COMDAT or weak symbols, most
entities with vague linkage are emitted as local symbols to avoid
duplicate definition errors from the linker.  This does not happen for
local statics in inlines, however, as having multiple copies almost
certainly breaks things.

7.4 C++ Interface and Implementation Pragmas
============================================

'#pragma interface' and '#pragma implementation' provide the user with a
way of explicitly directing the compiler to emit entities with vague
linkage (and debugging information) in a particular translation unit.

 _Note:_ These '#pragma's have been superceded as of GCC 2.7.2 by COMDAT
support and the "key method" heuristic mentioned in *note Vague
Linkage::.  Using them can actually cause your program to grow due to
unnecessary out-of-line copies of inline functions.

'#pragma interface'
'#pragma interface "SUBDIR/OBJECTS.h"'
     Use this directive in _header files_ that define object classes, to
     save space in most of the object files that use those classes.
     Normally, local copies of certain information (backup copies of
     inline member functions, debugging information, and the internal
     tables that implement virtual functions) must be kept in each
     object file that includes class definitions.  You can use this
     pragma to avoid such duplication.  When a header file containing
     '#pragma interface' is included in a compilation, this auxiliary
     information is not generated (unless the main input source file
     itself uses '#pragma implementation').  Instead, the object files
     contain references to be resolved at link time.

     The second form of this directive is useful for the case where you
     have multiple headers with the same name in different directories.
     If you use this form, you must specify the same string to '#pragma
     implementation'.

'#pragma implementation'
'#pragma implementation "OBJECTS.h"'
     Use this pragma in a _main input file_, when you want full output
     from included header files to be generated (and made globally
     visible).  The included header file, in turn, should use '#pragma
     interface'.  Backup copies of inline member functions, debugging
     information, and the internal tables used to implement virtual
     functions are all generated in implementation files.

     If you use '#pragma implementation' with no argument, it applies to
     an include file with the same basename(1) as your source file.  For
     example, in 'allclass.cc', giving just '#pragma implementation' by
     itself is equivalent to '#pragma implementation "allclass.h"'.

     Use the string argument if you want a single implementation file to
     include code from multiple header files.  (You must also use
     '#include' to include the header file; '#pragma implementation'
     only specifies how to use the file--it doesn't actually include
     it.)

     There is no way to split up the contents of a single header file
     into multiple implementation files.

 '#pragma implementation' and '#pragma interface' also have an effect on
function inlining.

 If you define a class in a header file marked with '#pragma interface',
the effect on an inline function defined in that class is similar to an
explicit 'extern' declaration--the compiler emits no code at all to
define an independent version of the function.  Its definition is used
only for inlining with its callers.

 Conversely, when you include the same header file in a main source file
that declares it as '#pragma implementation', the compiler emits code
for the function itself; this defines a version of the function that can
be found via pointers (or by callers compiled without inlining).  If all
calls to the function can be inlined, you can avoid emitting the
function by compiling with '-fno-implement-inlines'.  If any calls are
not inlined, you will get linker errors.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) A file's "basename" is the name stripped of all leading path
information and of trailing suffixes, such as '.h' or '.C' or '.cc'.


File: llvm.info,  Node: Template Instantiation,  Next: Bound member functions,  Prev: C++ Interface,  Up: C++ Extensions

7.5 Where's the Template?
=========================

C++ templates are the first language feature to require more
intelligence from the environment than one usually finds on a UNIX
system.  Somehow the compiler and linker have to make sure that each
template instance occurs exactly once in the executable if it is needed,
and not at all otherwise.  There are two basic approaches to this
problem, which are referred to as the Borland model and the Cfront
model.

Borland model
     Borland C++ solved the template instantiation problem by adding the
     code equivalent of common blocks to their linker; the compiler
     emits template instances in each translation unit that uses them,
     and the linker collapses them together.  The advantage of this
     model is that the linker only has to consider the object files
     themselves; there is no external complexity to worry about.  This
     disadvantage is that compilation time is increased because the
     template code is being compiled repeatedly.  Code written for this
     model tends to include definitions of all templates in the header
     file, since they must be seen to be instantiated.

Cfront model
     The AT&T C++ translator, Cfront, solved the template instantiation
     problem by creating the notion of a template repository, an
     automatically maintained place where template instances are stored.
     A more modern version of the repository works as follows: As
     individual object files are built, the compiler places any template
     definitions and instantiations encountered in the repository.  At
     link time, the link wrapper adds in the objects in the repository
     and compiles any needed instances that were not previously emitted.
     The advantages of this model are more optimal compilation speed and
     the ability to use the system linker; to implement the Borland
     model a compiler vendor also needs to replace the linker.  The
     disadvantages are vastly increased complexity, and thus potential
     for error; for some code this can be just as transparent, but in
     practice it can been very difficult to build multiple programs in
     one directory and one program in multiple directories.  Code
     written for this model tends to separate definitions of non-inline
     member templates into a separate file, which should be compiled
     separately.

 When used with GNU ld version 2.8 or later on an ELF system such as
GNU/Linux or Solaris 2, or on Microsoft Windows, G++ supports the
Borland model.  On other systems, G++ implements neither automatic
model.

 You have the following options for dealing with template
instantiations:

  1. Compile your template-using code with '-frepo'.  The compiler
     generates files with the extension '.rpo' listing all of the
     template instantiations used in the corresponding object files that
     could be instantiated there; the link wrapper, 'collect2', then
     updates the '.rpo' files to tell the compiler where to place those
     instantiations and rebuild any affected object files.  The
     link-time overhead is negligible after the first pass, as the
     compiler continues to place the instantiations in the same files.

     This is your best option for application code written for the
     Borland model, as it just works.  Code written for the Cfront model
     needs to be modified so that the template definitions are available
     at one or more points of instantiation; usually this is as simple
     as adding '#include <tmethods.cc>' to the end of each template
     header.

     For library code, if you want the library to provide all of the
     template instantiations it needs, just try to link all of its
     object files together; the link will fail, but cause the
     instantiations to be generated as a side effect.  Be warned,
     however, that this may cause conflicts if multiple libraries try to
     provide the same instantiations.  For greater control, use explicit
     instantiation as described in the next option.

  2. Compile your code with '-fno-implicit-templates' to disable the
     implicit generation of template instances, and explicitly
     instantiate all the ones you use.  This approach requires more
     knowledge of exactly which instances you need than do the others,
     but it's less mysterious and allows greater control.  You can
     scatter the explicit instantiations throughout your program,
     perhaps putting them in the translation units where the instances
     are used or the translation units that define the templates
     themselves; you can put all of the explicit instantiations you need
     into one big file; or you can create small files like

          #include "Foo.h"
          #include "Foo.cc"

          template class Foo<int>;
          template ostream& operator <<
                          (ostream&, const Foo<int>&);

     for each of the instances you need, and create a template
     instantiation library from those.

     If you are using Cfront-model code, you can probably get away with
     not using '-fno-implicit-templates' when compiling files that don't
     '#include' the member template definitions.

     If you use one big file to do the instantiations, you may want to
     compile it without '-fno-implicit-templates' so you get all of the
     instances required by your explicit instantiations (but not by any
     other files) without having to specify them as well.

     The ISO C++ 2011 standard allows forward declaration of explicit
     instantiations (with 'extern').  G++ supports explicit
     instantiation declarations in C++98 mode and has extended the
     template instantiation syntax to support instantiation of the
     compiler support data for a template class (i.e. the vtable)
     without instantiating any of its members (with 'inline'), and
     instantiation of only the static data members of a template class,
     without the support data or member functions (with 'static'):

          extern template int max (int, int);
          inline template class Foo<int>;
          static template class Foo<int>;

  3. Do nothing.  Pretend G++ does implement automatic instantiation
     management.  Code written for the Borland model works fine, but
     each translation unit contains instances of each of the templates
     it uses.  In a large program, this can lead to an unacceptable
     amount of code duplication.

7.6 Extracting the Function Pointer from a Bound Pointer to Member Function
===========================================================================

In C++, pointer to member functions (PMFs) are implemented using a wide
pointer of sorts to handle all the possible call mechanisms; the PMF
needs to store information about how to adjust the 'this' pointer, and
if the function pointed to is virtual, where to find the vtable, and
where in the vtable to look for the member function.  If you are using
PMFs in an inner loop, you should really reconsider that decision.  If
that is not an option, you can extract the pointer to the function that
would be called for a given object/PMF pair and call it directly inside
the inner loop, to save a bit of time.

 Note that you still pay the penalty for the call through a function
pointer; on most modern architectures, such a call defeats the branch
prediction features of the CPU.  This is also true of normal virtual
function calls.

 The syntax for this extension is

     extern A a;
     extern int (A::*fp)();
     typedef int (*fptr)(A *);

     fptr p = (fptr)(a.*fp);

 For PMF constants (i.e. expressions of the form '&Klasse::Member'), no
object is needed to obtain the address of the function.  They can be
converted to function pointers directly:

     fptr p1 = (fptr)(&A::foo);

 You must specify '-Wno-pmf-conversions' to use this extension.

7.7 C++-Specific Variable, Function, and Type Attributes
========================================================

Some attributes only make sense for C++ programs.

'abi_tag ("TAG", ...)'
     The 'abi_tag' attribute can be applied to a function or class
     declaration.  It modifies the mangled name of the function or class
     to incorporate the tag name, in order to distinguish the function
     or class from an earlier version with a different ABI; perhaps the
     class has changed size, or the function has a different return type
     that is not encoded in the mangled name.

     The argument can be a list of strings of arbitrary length.  The
     strings are sorted on output, so the order of the list is
     unimportant.

     A redeclaration of a function or class must not add new ABI tags,
     since doing so would change the mangled name.

     The ABI tags apply to a name, so all instantiations and
     specializations of a template have the same tags.  The attribute
     will be ignored if applied to an explicit specialization or
     instantiation.

     The '-Wabi-tag' flag enables a warning about a class which does not
     have all the ABI tags used by its subobjects and virtual functions;
     for users with code that needs to coexist with an earlier ABI,
     using this option can help to find all affected types that need to
     be tagged.

'init_priority (PRIORITY)'

     In Standard C++, objects defined at namespace scope are guaranteed
     to be initialized in an order in strict accordance with that of
     their definitions _in a given translation unit_.  No guarantee is
     made for initializations across translation units.  However, GNU
     C++ allows users to control the order of initialization of objects
     defined at namespace scope with the 'init_priority' attribute by
     specifying a relative PRIORITY, a constant integral expression
     currently bounded between 101 and 65535 inclusive.  Lower numbers
     indicate a higher priority.

     In the following example, 'A' would normally be created before 'B',
     but the 'init_priority' attribute reverses that order:

          Some_Class  A  __attribute__ ((init_priority (2000)));
          Some_Class  B  __attribute__ ((init_priority (543)));

     Note that the particular values of PRIORITY do not matter; only
     their relative ordering.

'java_interface'

     This type attribute informs C++ that the class is a Java interface.
     It may only be applied to classes declared within an 'extern
     "Java"' block.  Calls to methods declared in this interface are
     dispatched using GCJ's interface table mechanism, instead of
     regular virtual table dispatch.

'warn_unused'

     For C++ types with non-trivial constructors and/or destructors it
     is impossible for the compiler to determine whether a variable of
     this type is truly unused if it is not referenced.  This type
     attribute informs the compiler that variables of this type should
     be warned about if they appear to be unused, just like variables of
     fundamental types.

     This attribute is appropriate for types which just represent a
     value, such as 'std::string'; it is not appropriate for types which
     control a resource, such as 'std::mutex'.

     This attribute is also accepted in C, but it is unnecessary because
     C does not have constructors or destructors.

7.8 Function Multiversioning
============================

With the GNU C++ front end, for x86 targets, you may specify multiple
versions of a function, where each function is specialized for a
specific target feature.  At runtime, the appropriate version of the
function is automatically executed depending on the characteristics of
the execution platform.  Here is an example.

     __attribute__ ((target ("default")))
     int foo ()
     {
       // The default version of foo.
       return 0;
     }

     __attribute__ ((target ("sse4.2")))
     int foo ()
     {
       // foo version for SSE4.2
       return 1;
     }

     __attribute__ ((target ("arch=atom")))
     int foo ()
     {
       // foo version for the Intel ATOM processor
       return 2;
     }

     __attribute__ ((target ("arch=amdfam10")))
     int foo ()
     {
       // foo version for the AMD Family 0x10 processors.
       return 3;
     }

     int main ()
     {
       int (*p)() = &foo;
       assert ((*p) () == foo ());
       return 0;
     }

 In the above example, four versions of function foo are created.  The
first version of foo with the target attribute "default" is the default
version.  This version gets executed when no other target specific
version qualifies for execution on a particular platform.  A new version
of foo is created by using the same function signature but with a
different target string.  Function foo is called or a pointer to it is
taken just like a regular function.  GCC takes care of doing the
dispatching to call the right version at runtime.  Refer to the GCC wiki
on Function Multiversioning
(http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/FunctionMultiVersioning) for more details.

7.9 Namespace Association
=========================

*Caution:* The semantics of this extension are equivalent to C++ 2011
inline namespaces.  Users should use inline namespaces instead as this
extension will be removed in future versions of G++.

 A using-directive with '__attribute ((strong))' is stronger than a
normal using-directive in two ways:

   * Templates from the used namespace can be specialized and explicitly
     instantiated as though they were members of the using namespace.

   * The using namespace is considered an associated namespace of all
     templates in the used namespace for purposes of argument-dependent
     name lookup.

 The used namespace must be nested within the using namespace so that
normal unqualified lookup works properly.

 This is useful for composing a namespace transparently from
implementation namespaces.  For example:

     namespace std {
       namespace debug {
         template <class T> struct A { };
       }
       using namespace debug __attribute ((__strong__));
       template <> struct A<int> { };   // OK to specialize

       template <class T> void f (A<T>);
     }

     int main()
     {
       f (std::A<float>());             // lookup finds std::f
       f (std::A<int>());
     }

7.11 Java Exceptions
====================

The Java language uses a slightly different exception handling model
from C++.  Normally, GNU C++ automatically detects when you are writing
C++ code that uses Java exceptions, and handle them appropriately.
However, if C++ code only needs to execute destructors when Java
exceptions are thrown through it, GCC guesses incorrectly.  Sample
problematic code is:

       struct S { ~S(); };
       extern void bar();    // is written in Java, and may throw exceptions
       void foo()
       {
         S s;
         bar();
       }

The usual effect of an incorrect guess is a link failure, complaining of
a missing routine called '__gxx_personality_v0'.

 You can inform the compiler that Java exceptions are to be used in a
translation unit, irrespective of what it might think, by writing
'#pragma GCC java_exceptions' at the head of the file.  This '#pragma'
must appear before any functions that throw or catch exceptions, or run
destructors when exceptions are thrown through them.

 You cannot mix Java and C++ exceptions in the same translation unit.
It is believed to be safe to throw a C++ exception from one file through
another file compiled for the Java exception model, or vice versa, but
there may be bugs in this area.

7.12 Deprecated Features
========================

In the past, the GNU C++ compiler was extended to experiment with new
features, at a time when the C++ language was still evolving.  Now that
the C++ standard is complete, some of those features are superseded by
superior alternatives.  Using the old features might cause a warning in
some cases that the feature will be dropped in the future.  In other
cases, the feature might be gone already.

 While the list below is not exhaustive, it documents some of the
options that are now deprecated:

'-fexternal-templates'
'-falt-external-templates'
     These are two of the many ways for G++ to implement template
     instantiation.  *Note Template Instantiation::.  The C++ standard
     clearly defines how template definitions have to be organized
     across implementation units.  G++ has an implicit instantiation
     mechanism that should work just fine for standard-conforming code.

'-fstrict-prototype'
'-fno-strict-prototype'
     Previously it was possible to use an empty prototype parameter list
     to indicate an unspecified number of parameters (like C), rather
     than no parameters, as C++ demands.  This feature has been removed,
     except where it is required for backwards compatibility.  *Note
     Backwards Compatibility::.

 G++ allows a virtual function returning 'void *' to be overridden by
one returning a different pointer type.  This extension to the covariant
return type rules is now deprecated and will be removed from a future
version.

 The G++ minimum and maximum operators ('<?' and '>?') and their
compound forms ('<?=') and '>?=') have been deprecated and are now
removed from G++.  Code using these operators should be modified to use
'std::min' and 'std::max' instead.

 The named return value extension has been deprecated, and is now
removed from G++.

 The use of initializer lists with new expressions has been deprecated,
and is now removed from G++.

 Floating and complex non-type template parameters have been deprecated,
and are now removed from G++.

 The implicit typename extension has been deprecated and is now removed
from G++.

 The use of default arguments in function pointers, function typedefs
and other places where they are not permitted by the standard is
deprecated and will be removed from a future version of G++.

 G++ allows floating-point literals to appear in integral constant
expressions, e.g. ' enum E { e = int(2.2 * 3.7) } ' This extension is
deprecated and will be removed from a future version.

 G++ allows static data members of const floating-point type to be
declared with an initializer in a class definition.  The standard only
allows initializers for static members of const integral types and const
enumeration types so this extension has been deprecated and will be
removed from a future version.

7.13 Backwards Compatibility
============================

Now that there is a definitive ISO standard C++, G++ has a specification
to adhere to.  The C++ language evolved over time, and features that
used to be acceptable in previous drafts of the standard, such as the
ARM [Annotated C++ Reference Manual], are no longer accepted.  In order
to allow compilation of C++ written to such drafts, G++ contains some
backwards compatibilities.  _All such backwards compatibility features
are liable to disappear in future versions of G++._  They should be
considered deprecated.  *Note Deprecated Features::.

'For scope'
     If a variable is declared at for scope, it used to remain in scope
     until the end of the scope that contained the for statement (rather
     than just within the for scope).  G++ retains this, but issues a
     warning, if such a variable is accessed outside the for scope.

'Implicit C language'
     Old C system header files did not contain an 'extern "C" {...}'
     scope to set the language.  On such systems, all header files are
     implicitly scoped inside a C language scope.  Also, an empty
     prototype '()' is treated as an unspecified number of arguments,
     rather than no arguments, as C++ demands.

8.1 GNU Objective-C Runtime API
===============================

This section is specific for the GNU Objective-C runtime.  If you are
using a different runtime, you can skip it.

 The GNU Objective-C runtime provides an API that allows you to interact
with the Objective-C runtime system, querying the live runtime
structures and even manipulating them.  This allows you for example to
inspect and navigate classes, methods and protocols; to define new
classes or new methods, and even to modify existing classes or
protocols.

 If you are using a "Foundation" library such as GNUstep-Base, this
library will provide you with a rich set of functionality to do most of
the inspection tasks, and you probably will only need direct access to
the GNU Objective-C runtime API to define new classes or methods.

* Modern GNU Objective-C runtime API::
* Traditional GNU Objective-C runtime API::


File: llvm.info,  Node: Modern GNU Objective-C runtime API,  Next: Traditional GNU Objective-C runtime API,  Up: GNU Objective-C runtime API

8.1.1 Modern GNU Objective-C Runtime API
----------------------------------------

The GNU Objective-C runtime provides an API which is similar to the one
provided by the "Objective-C 2.0" Apple/NeXT Objective-C runtime.  The
API is documented in the public header files of the GNU Objective-C
runtime:

   * 'objc/objc.h': this is the basic Objective-C header file, defining
     the basic Objective-C types such as 'id', 'Class' and 'BOOL'.  You
     have to include this header to do almost anything with Objective-C.

   * 'objc/runtime.h': this header declares most of the public runtime
     API functions allowing you to inspect and manipulate the
     Objective-C runtime data structures.  These functions are fairly
     standardized across Objective-C runtimes and are almost identical
     to the Apple/NeXT Objective-C runtime ones.  It does not declare
     functions in some specialized areas (constructing and forwarding
     message invocations, threading) which are in the other headers
     below.  You have to include 'objc/objc.h' and 'objc/runtime.h' to
     use any of the functions, such as 'class_getName()', declared in
     'objc/runtime.h'.

   * 'objc/message.h': this header declares public functions used to
     construct, deconstruct and forward message invocations.  Because
     messaging is done in quite a different way on different runtimes,
     functions in this header are specific to the GNU Objective-C
     runtime implementation.

   * 'objc/objc-exception.h': this header declares some public functions
     related to Objective-C exceptions.  For example functions in this
     header allow you to throw an Objective-C exception from plain C/C++
     code.

   * 'objc/objc-sync.h': this header declares some public functions
     related to the Objective-C '@synchronized()' syntax, allowing you
     to emulate an Objective-C '@synchronized()' block in plain C/C++
     code.

   * 'objc/thr.h': this header declares a public runtime API threading
     layer that is only provided by the GNU Objective-C runtime.  It
     declares functions such as 'objc_mutex_lock()', which provide a
     platform-independent set of threading functions.

 The header files contain detailed documentation for each function in
the GNU Objective-C runtime API.

8.1.2 Traditional GNU Objective-C Runtime API
---------------------------------------------

The GNU Objective-C runtime used to provide a different API, which we
call the "traditional" GNU Objective-C runtime API. Functions belonging
to this API are easy to recognize because they use a different naming
convention, such as 'class_get_super_class()' (traditional API) instead
of 'class_getSuperclass()' (modern API). Software using this API
includes the file 'objc/objc-api.h' where it is declared.

 Starting with GCC 4.7.0, the traditional GNU runtime API is no longer
available.


File: llvm.info,  Node: Executing code before main,  Next: Type encoding,  Prev: GNU Objective-C runtime API,  Up: Objective-C

8.2 '+load': Executing Code before 'main'
=========================================

This section is specific for the GNU Objective-C runtime.  If you are
using a different runtime, you can skip it.

 The GNU Objective-C runtime provides a way that allows you to execute
code before the execution of the program enters the 'main' function.
The code is executed on a per-class and a per-category basis, through a
special class method '+load'.

 This facility is very useful if you want to initialize global variables
which can be accessed by the program directly, without sending a message
to the class first.  The usual way to initialize global variables, in
the '+initialize' method, might not be useful because '+initialize' is
only called when the first message is sent to a class object, which in
some cases could be too late.

 Suppose for example you have a 'FileStream' class that declares
'Stdin', 'Stdout' and 'Stderr' as global variables, like below:


     FileStream *Stdin = nil;
     FileStream *Stdout = nil;
     FileStream *Stderr = nil;

     @implementation FileStream

     + (void)initialize
     {
         Stdin = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:0];
         Stdout = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:1];
         Stderr = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:2];
     }

     /* Other methods here */
     @end


 In this example, the initialization of 'Stdin', 'Stdout' and 'Stderr'
in '+initialize' occurs too late.  The programmer can send a message to
one of these objects before the variables are actually initialized, thus
sending messages to the 'nil' object.  The '+initialize' method which
actually initializes the global variables is not invoked until the first
message is sent to the class object.  The solution would require these
variables to be initialized just before entering 'main'.

 The correct solution of the above problem is to use the '+load' method
instead of '+initialize':


     @implementation FileStream

     + (void)load
     {
         Stdin = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:0];
         Stdout = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:1];
         Stderr = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:2];
     }

     /* Other methods here */
     @end


 The '+load' is a method that is not overridden by categories.  If a
class and a category of it both implement '+load', both methods are
invoked.  This allows some additional initializations to be performed in
a category.

 This mechanism is not intended to be a replacement for '+initialize'.
You should be aware of its limitations when you decide to use it instead
of '+initialize'.

* Menu:

* What you can and what you cannot do in +load::


File: llvm.info,  Node: What you can and what you cannot do in +load,  Up: Executing code before main

8.2.1 What You Can and Cannot Do in '+load'
-------------------------------------------

'+load' is to be used only as a last resort.  Because it is executed
very early, most of the Objective-C runtime machinery will not be ready
when '+load' is executed; hence '+load' works best for executing C code
that is independent on the Objective-C runtime.

 The '+load' implementation in the GNU runtime guarantees you the
following things:

   * you can write whatever C code you like;

   * you can allocate and send messages to objects whose class is
     implemented in the same file;

   * the '+load' implementation of all super classes of a class are
     executed before the '+load' of that class is executed;

   * the '+load' implementation of a class is executed before the
     '+load' implementation of any category.

 In particular, the following things, even if they can work in a
particular case, are not guaranteed:

   * allocation of or sending messages to arbitrary objects;

   * allocation of or sending messages to objects whose classes have a
     category implemented in the same file;

   * sending messages to Objective-C constant strings ('@"this is a
     constant string"');

 You should make no assumptions about receiving '+load' in sibling
classes when you write '+load' of a class.  The order in which sibling
classes receive '+load' is not guaranteed.

 The order in which '+load' and '+initialize' are called could be
problematic if this matters.  If you don't allocate objects inside
'+load', it is guaranteed that '+load' is called before '+initialize'.
If you create an object inside '+load' the '+initialize' method of
object's class is invoked even if '+load' was not invoked.  Note if you
explicitly call '+load' on a class, '+initialize' will be called first.
To avoid possible problems try to implement only one of these methods.

 The '+load' method is also invoked when a bundle is dynamically loaded
into your running program.  This happens automatically without any
intervening operation from you.  When you write bundles and you need to
write '+load' you can safely create and send messages to objects whose
classes already exist in the running program.  The same restrictions as
above apply to classes defined in bundle.

8.3 Type Encoding
=================

This is an advanced section.  Type encodings are used extensively by the
compiler and by the runtime, but you generally do not need to know about
them to use Objective-C.

 The Objective-C compiler generates type encodings for all the types.
These type encodings are used at runtime to find out information about
selectors and methods and about objects and classes.

 The types are encoded in the following way:

'_Bool'            'B'
'char'             'c'
'unsigned char'    'C'
'short'            's'
'unsigned short'   'S'
'int'              'i'
'unsigned int'     'I'
'long'             'l'
'unsigned long'    'L'
'long long'        'q'
'unsigned long     'Q'
long'
'float'            'f'
'double'           'd'
'long double'      'D'
'void'             'v'
'id'               '@'
'Class'            '#'
'SEL'              ':'
'char*'            '*'
'enum'             an 'enum' is encoded exactly as the integer type
                   that the compiler uses for it, which depends on the
                   enumeration values.  Often the compiler users
                   'unsigned int', which is then encoded as 'I'.
unknown type       '?'
Complex types      'j' followed by the inner type.  For example
                   '_Complex double' is encoded as "jd".
bit-fields         'b' followed by the starting position of the
                   bit-field, the type of the bit-field and the size of
                   the bit-field (the bit-fields encoding was changed
                   from the NeXT's compiler encoding, see below)

 The encoding of bit-fields has changed to allow bit-fields to be
properly handled by the runtime functions that compute sizes and
alignments of types that contain bit-fields.  The previous encoding
contained only the size of the bit-field.  Using only this information
it is not possible to reliably compute the size occupied by the
bit-field.  This is very important in the presence of the Boehm's
garbage collector because the objects are allocated using the typed
memory facility available in this collector.  The typed memory
allocation requires information about where the pointers are located
inside the object.

 The position in the bit-field is the position, counting in bits, of the
bit closest to the beginning of the structure.

 The non-atomic types are encoded as follows:

pointers       '^' followed by the pointed type.
arrays         '[' followed by the number of elements in the array
               followed by the type of the elements followed by ']'
structures     '{' followed by the name of the structure (or '?' if the
               structure is unnamed), the '=' sign, the type of the
               members and by '}'
unions         '(' followed by the name of the structure (or '?' if the
               union is unnamed), the '=' sign, the type of the members
               followed by ')'
vectors        '![' followed by the vector_size (the number of bytes
               composing the vector) followed by a comma, followed by
               the alignment (in bytes) of the vector, followed by the
               type of the elements followed by ']'

 Here are some types and their encodings, as they are generated by the
compiler on an i386 machine:


Objective-C type   Compiler encoding
     int a[10];    '[10i]'
     struct {      '{?=i[3f]b128i3b131i2c}'
       int i;
       float f[3];
       int a:3;
       int b:2;
       char c;
     }
     int a __attribute__ ((vector_size (16)));'![16,16i]' (alignment would depend on the machine)


 In addition to the types the compiler also encodes the type specifiers.
The table below describes the encoding of the current Objective-C type
specifiers:


Specifier          Encoding
'const'            'r'
'in'               'n'
'inout'            'N'
'out'              'o'
'bycopy'           'O'
'byref'            'R'
'oneway'           'V'


 The type specifiers are encoded just before the type.  Unlike types
however, the type specifiers are only encoded when they appear in method
argument types.

 Note how 'const' interacts with pointers:


Objective-C type   Compiler encoding
     const int     'ri'
     const int*    '^ri'
     int *const    'r^i'


 'const int*' is a pointer to a 'const int', and so is encoded as '^ri'.
'int* const', instead, is a 'const' pointer to an 'int', and so is
encoded as 'r^i'.

 Finally, there is a complication when encoding 'const char *' versus
'char * const'.  Because 'char *' is encoded as '*' and not as '^c',
there is no way to express the fact that 'r' applies to the pointer or
to the pointee.

 Hence, it is assumed as a convention that 'r*' means 'const char *'
(since it is what is most often meant), and there is no way to encode
'char *const'.  'char *const' would simply be encoded as '*', and the
'const' is lost.

* Method signatures::

8.3.1 Legacy Type Encoding
--------------------------

Unfortunately, historically GCC used to have a number of bugs in its
encoding code.  The NeXT runtime expects GCC to emit type encodings in
this historical format (compatible with GCC-3.3), so when using the NeXT
runtime, GCC will introduce on purpose a number of incorrect encodings:

   * the read-only qualifier of the pointee gets emitted before the '^'.
     The read-only qualifier of the pointer itself gets ignored, unless
     it is a typedef.  Also, the 'r' is only emitted for the outermost
     type.

   * 32-bit longs are encoded as 'l' or 'L', but not always.  For
     typedefs, the compiler uses 'i' or 'I' instead if encoding a struct
     field or a pointer.

   * 'enum's are always encoded as 'i' (int) even if they are actually
     unsigned or long.

 In addition to that, the NeXT runtime uses a different encoding for
bitfields.  It encodes them as 'b' followed by the size, without a bit
offset or the underlying field type.


File: llvm.info,  Node: @encode,  Next: Method signatures,  Prev: Legacy type encoding,  Up: Type encoding

8.3.2 '@encode'
---------------

GNU Objective-C supports the '@encode' syntax that allows you to create
a type encoding from a C/Objective-C type.  For example, '@encode(int)'
is compiled by the compiler into '"i"'.

 '@encode' does not support type qualifiers other than 'const'.  For
example, '@encode(const char*)' is valid and is compiled into '"r*"',
while '@encode(bycopy char *)' is invalid and will cause a compilation
error.


File: llvm.info,  Node: Method signatures,  Prev: @encode,  Up: Type encoding

8.3.3 Method Signatures
-----------------------

This section documents the encoding of method types, which is rarely
needed to use Objective-C. You should skip it at a first reading; the
runtime provides functions that will work on methods and can walk
through the list of parameters and interpret them for you.  These
functions are part of the public "API" and are the preferred way to
interact with method signatures from user code.

 But if you need to debug a problem with method signatures and need to
know how they are implemented (i.e., the "ABI"), read on.

 Methods have their "signature" encoded and made available to the
runtime.  The "signature" encodes all the information required to
dynamically build invocations of the method at runtime: return type and
arguments.

 The "signature" is a null-terminated string, composed of the following:

   * The return type, including type qualifiers.  For example, a method
     returning 'int' would have 'i' here.

   * The total size (in bytes) required to pass all the parameters.
     This includes the two hidden parameters (the object 'self' and the
     method selector '_cmd').

   * Each argument, with the type encoding, followed by the offset (in
     bytes) of the argument in the list of parameters.

 For example, a method with no arguments and returning 'int' would have
the signature 'i8@0:4' if the size of a pointer is 4.  The signature is
interpreted as follows: the 'i' is the return type (an 'int'), the '8'
is the total size of the parameters in bytes (two pointers each of size
4), the '@0' is the first parameter (an object at byte offset '0') and
':4' is the second parameter (a 'SEL' at byte offset '4').

 You can easily find more examples by running the "strings" program on
an Objective-C object file compiled by GCC. You'll see a lot of strings
that look very much like 'i8@0:4'.  They are signatures of Objective-C
methods.

8.4 Garbage Collection
======================

This section is specific for the GNU Objective-C runtime.  If you are
using a different runtime, you can skip it.

 Support for garbage collection with the GNU runtime has been added by
using a powerful conservative garbage collector, known as the
Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector.

 To enable the support for it you have to configure the compiler using
an additional argument, '--enable-objc-gc'.  This will build the
boehm-gc library, and build an additional runtime library which has
several enhancements to support the garbage collector.  The new library
has a new name, 'libobjc_gc.a' to not conflict with the
non-garbage-collected library.

 When the garbage collector is used, the objects are allocated using the
so-called typed memory allocation mechanism available in the
Boehm-Demers-Weiser collector.  This mode requires precise information
on where pointers are located inside objects.  This information is
computed once per class, immediately after the class has been
initialized.

 There is a new runtime function 'class_ivar_set_gcinvisible()' which
can be used to declare a so-called "weak pointer" reference.  Such a
pointer is basically hidden for the garbage collector; this can be
useful in certain situations, especially when you want to keep track of
the allocated objects, yet allow them to be collected.  This kind of
pointers can only be members of objects, you cannot declare a global
pointer as a weak reference.  Every type which is a pointer type can be
declared a weak pointer, including 'id', 'Class' and 'SEL'.

 Here is an example of how to use this feature.  Suppose you want to
implement a class whose instances hold a weak pointer reference; the
following class does this:


     @interface WeakPointer : Object
     {
         const void* weakPointer;
     }

     - initWithPointer:(const void*)p;
     - (const void*)weakPointer;
     @end


     @implementation WeakPointer

     + (void)initialize
     {
       if (self == objc_lookUpClass ("WeakPointer"))
         class_ivar_set_gcinvisible (self, "weakPointer", YES);
     }

     - initWithPointer:(const void*)p
     {
       weakPointer = p;
       return self;
     }

     - (const void*)weakPointer
     {
       return weakPointer;
     }

     @end


 Weak pointers are supported through a new type character specifier
represented by the '!' character.  The 'class_ivar_set_gcinvisible()'
function adds or removes this specifier to the string type description
of the instance variable named as argument.


File: llvm.info,  Node: Constant string objects,  Next: compatibility_alias,  Prev: Garbage Collection,  Up: Objective-C

8.5 Constant String Objects
===========================

GNU Objective-C provides constant string objects that are generated
directly by the compiler.  You declare a constant string object by
prefixing a C constant string with the character '@':

       id myString = @"this is a constant string object";

 The constant string objects are by default instances of the
'NXConstantString' class which is provided by the GNU Objective-C
runtime.  To get the definition of this class you must include the
'objc/NXConstStr.h' header file.

 User defined libraries may want to implement their own constant string
class.  To be able to support them, the GNU Objective-C compiler
provides a new command line options
'-fconstant-string-class=CLASS-NAME'.  The provided class should adhere
to a strict structure, the same as 'NXConstantString''s structure:


     @interface MyConstantStringClass
     {
       Class isa;
       char *c_string;
       unsigned int len;
     }
     @end


 'NXConstantString' inherits from 'Object'; user class libraries may
choose to inherit the customized constant string class from a different
class than 'Object'.  There is no requirement in the methods the
constant string class has to implement, but the final ivar layout of the
class must be the compatible with the given structure.

 When the compiler creates the statically allocated constant string
object, the 'c_string' field will be filled by the compiler with the
string; the 'length' field will be filled by the compiler with the
string length; the 'isa' pointer will be filled with 'NULL' by the
compiler, and it will later be fixed up automatically at runtime by the
GNU Objective-C runtime library to point to the class which was set by
the '-fconstant-string-class' option when the object file is loaded (if
you wonder how it works behind the scenes, the name of the class to use,
and the list of static objects to fixup, are stored by the compiler in
the object file in a place where the GNU runtime library will find them
at runtime).

 As a result, when a file is compiled with the '-fconstant-string-class'
option, all the constant string objects will be instances of the class
specified as argument to this option.  It is possible to have multiple
compilation units referring to different constant string classes,
neither the compiler nor the linker impose any restrictions in doing
this.

8.6 'compatibility_alias'
=========================

The keyword '@compatibility_alias' allows you to define a class name as
equivalent to another class name.  For example:

     @compatibility_alias WOApplication GSWApplication;

 tells the compiler that each time it encounters 'WOApplication' as a
class name, it should replace it with 'GSWApplication' (that is,
'WOApplication' is just an alias for 'GSWApplication').

 There are some constraints on how this can be used--

   * 'WOApplication' (the alias) must not be an existing class;

   * 'GSWApplication' (the real class) must be an existing class.

8.7 Exceptions
==============

GNU Objective-C provides exception support built into the language, as
in the following example:

       @try {
         ...
            @throw expr;
         ...
       }
       @catch (AnObjCClass *exc) {
         ...
           @throw expr;
         ...
           @throw;
         ...
       }
       @catch (AnotherClass *exc) {
         ...
       }
       @catch (id allOthers) {
         ...
       }
       @finally {
         ...
           @throw expr;
         ...
       }

 The '@throw' statement may appear anywhere in an Objective-C or
Objective-C++ program; when used inside of a '@catch' block, the
'@throw' may appear without an argument (as shown above), in which case
the object caught by the '@catch' will be rethrown.

 Note that only (pointers to) Objective-C objects may be thrown and
caught using this scheme.  When an object is thrown, it will be caught
by the nearest '@catch' clause capable of handling objects of that type,
analogously to how 'catch' blocks work in C++ and Java.  A '@catch(id
...)' clause (as shown above) may also be provided to catch any and all
Objective-C exceptions not caught by previous '@catch' clauses (if any).

 The '@finally' clause, if present, will be executed upon exit from the
immediately preceding '@try ... @catch' section.  This will happen
regardless of whether any exceptions are thrown, caught or rethrown
inside the '@try ... @catch' section, analogously to the behavior of the
'finally' clause in Java.

 There are several caveats to using the new exception mechanism:

   * The '-fobjc-exceptions' command line option must be used when
     compiling Objective-C files that use exceptions.

   * With the GNU runtime, exceptions are always implemented as "native"
     exceptions and it is recommended that the '-fexceptions' and
     '-shared-libgcc' options are used when linking.

   * With the NeXT runtime, although currently designed to be binary
     compatible with 'NS_HANDLER'-style idioms provided by the
     'NSException' class, the new exceptions can only be used on Mac OS
     X 10.3 (Panther) and later systems, due to additional functionality
     needed in the NeXT Objective-C runtime.

   * As mentioned above, the new exceptions do not support handling
     types other than Objective-C objects.  Furthermore, when used from
     Objective-C++, the Objective-C exception model does not
     interoperate with C++ exceptions at this time.  This means you
     cannot '@throw' an exception from Objective-C and 'catch' it in
     C++, or vice versa (i.e., 'throw ... @catch').

8.8 Synchronization
===================

GNU Objective-C provides support for synchronized blocks:

       @synchronized (ObjCClass *guard) {
         ...
       }

 Upon entering the '@synchronized' block, a thread of execution shall
first check whether a lock has been placed on the corresponding 'guard'
object by another thread.  If it has, the current thread shall wait
until the other thread relinquishes its lock.  Once 'guard' becomes
available, the current thread will place its own lock on it, execute the
code contained in the '@synchronized' block, and finally relinquish the
lock (thereby making 'guard' available to other threads).

 Unlike Java, Objective-C does not allow for entire methods to be marked
'@synchronized'.  Note that throwing exceptions out of '@synchronized'
blocks is allowed, and will cause the guarding object to be unlocked
properly.

 Because of the interactions between synchronization and exception
handling, you can only use '@synchronized' when compiling with
exceptions enabled, that is with the command line option
'-fobjc-exceptions'.

8.9.1 Using Fast Enumeration
----------------------------

GNU Objective-C provides support for the fast enumeration syntax:

       id array = ...;
       id object;

       for (object in array)
       {
         /* Do something with 'object' */
       }

 'array' needs to be an Objective-C object (usually a collection object,
for example an array, a dictionary or a set) which implements the "Fast
Enumeration Protocol" (see below).  If you are using a Foundation
library such as GNUstep Base or Apple Cocoa Foundation, all collection
objects in the library implement this protocol and can be used in this
way.

 The code above would iterate over all objects in 'array'.  For each of
them, it assigns it to 'object', then executes the 'Do something with
'object'' statements.

 Here is a fully worked-out example using a Foundation library (which
provides the implementation of 'NSArray', 'NSString' and 'NSLog'):

       NSArray *array = [NSArray arrayWithObjects: @"1", @"2", @"3", nil];
       NSString *object;

       for (object in array)
         NSLog (@"Iterating over %@", object);

8.9.2 C99-Like Fast Enumeration Syntax
--------------------------------------

A c99-like declaration syntax is also allowed:

       id array = ...;

       for (id object in array)
       {
         /* Do something with 'object'  */
       }

 this is completely equivalent to:

       id array = ...;

       {
         id object;
         for (object in array)
         {
           /* Do something with 'object'  */
         }
       }

 but can save some typing.

 Note that the option '-std=c99' is not required to allow this syntax in
Objective-C.

8.9.3 Fast Enumeration Details
------------------------------

Here is a more technical description with the gory details.  Consider
the code

       for (OBJECT EXPRESSION in COLLECTION EXPRESSION)
       {
         STATEMENTS
       }

 here is what happens when you run it:

   * 'COLLECTION EXPRESSION' is evaluated exactly once and the result is
     used as the collection object to iterate over.  This means it is
     safe to write code such as 'for (object in [NSDictionary
     keyEnumerator]) ...'.

   * the iteration is implemented by the compiler by repeatedly getting
     batches of objects from the collection object using the fast
     enumeration protocol (see below), then iterating over all objects
     in the batch.  This is faster than a normal enumeration where
     objects are retrieved one by one (hence the name "fast
     enumeration").

   * if there are no objects in the collection, then 'OBJECT EXPRESSION'
     is set to 'nil' and the loop immediately terminates.

   * if there are objects in the collection, then for each object in the
     collection (in the order they are returned) 'OBJECT EXPRESSION' is
     set to the object, then 'STATEMENTS' are executed.

   * 'STATEMENTS' can contain 'break' and 'continue' commands, which
     will abort the iteration or skip to the next loop iteration as
     expected.

   * when the iteration ends because there are no more objects to
     iterate over, 'OBJECT EXPRESSION' is set to 'nil'.  This allows you
     to determine whether the iteration finished because a 'break'
     command was used (in which case 'OBJECT EXPRESSION' will remain set
     to the last object that was iterated over) or because it iterated
     over all the objects (in which case 'OBJECT EXPRESSION' will be set
     to 'nil').

   * 'STATEMENTS' must not make any changes to the collection object; if
     they do, it is a hard error and the fast enumeration terminates by
     invoking 'objc_enumerationMutation', a runtime function that
     normally aborts the program but which can be customized by
     Foundation libraries via 'objc_set_mutation_handler' to do
     something different, such as raising an exception.


File: llvm.info,  Node: Fast enumeration protocol,  Prev: Fast enumeration details,  Up: Fast enumeration

8.9.4 Fast Enumeration Protocol
-------------------------------

If you want your own collection object to be usable with fast
enumeration, you need to have it implement the method

     - (unsigned long) countByEnumeratingWithState: (NSFastEnumerationState *)state
                                           objects: (id *)objects
                                             count: (unsigned long)len;

 where 'NSFastEnumerationState' must be defined in your code as follows:

     typedef struct
     {
       unsigned long state;
       id            *itemsPtr;
       unsigned long *mutationsPtr;
       unsigned long extra[5];
     } NSFastEnumerationState;

 If no 'NSFastEnumerationState' is defined in your code, the compiler
will automatically replace 'NSFastEnumerationState *' with 'struct
__objcFastEnumerationState *', where that type is silently defined by
the compiler in an identical way.  This can be confusing and we
recommend that you define 'NSFastEnumerationState' (as shown above)
instead.

 The method is called repeatedly during a fast enumeration to retrieve
batches of objects.  Each invocation of the method should retrieve the
next batch of objects.

 The return value of the method is the number of objects in the current
batch; this should not exceed 'len', which is the maximum size of a
batch as requested by the caller.  The batch itself is returned in the
'itemsPtr' field of the 'NSFastEnumerationState' struct.

 To help with returning the objects, the 'objects' array is a C array
preallocated by the caller (on the stack) of size 'len'.  In many cases
you can put the objects you want to return in that 'objects' array, then
do 'itemsPtr = objects'.  But you don't have to; if your collection
already has the objects to return in some form of C array, it could
return them from there instead.

 The 'state' and 'extra' fields of the 'NSFastEnumerationState'
structure allows your collection object to keep track of the state of
the enumeration.  In a simple array implementation, 'state' may keep
track of the index of the last object that was returned, and 'extra' may
be unused.

 The 'mutationsPtr' field of the 'NSFastEnumerationState' is used to
keep track of mutations.  It should point to a number; before working on
each object, the fast enumeration loop will check that this number has
not changed.  If it has, a mutation has happened and the fast
enumeration will abort.  So, 'mutationsPtr' could be set to point to
some sort of version number of your collection, which is increased by
one every time there is a change (for example when an object is added or
removed).  Or, if you are content with less strict mutation checks, it
could point to the number of objects in your collection or some other
value that can be checked to perform an approximate check that the
collection has not been mutated.

 Finally, note how we declared the 'len' argument and the return value
to be of type 'unsigned long'.  They could also be declared to be of
type 'unsigned int' and everything would still work.

8.10 Messaging with the GNU Objective-C Runtime
===============================================

This section is specific for the GNU Objective-C runtime.  If you are
using a different runtime, you can skip it.

 The implementation of messaging in the GNU Objective-C runtime is
designed to be portable, and so is based on standard C.

 Sending a message in the GNU Objective-C runtime is composed of two
separate steps.  First, there is a call to the lookup function,
'objc_msg_lookup ()' (or, in the case of messages to super,
'objc_msg_lookup_super ()').  This runtime function takes as argument
the receiver and the selector of the method to be called; it returns the
'IMP', that is a pointer to the function implementing the method.  The
second step of method invocation consists of casting this pointer
function to the appropriate function pointer type, and calling the
function pointed to it with the right arguments.

 For example, when the compiler encounters a method invocation such as
'[object init]', it compiles it into a call to 'objc_msg_lookup (object,
@selector(init))' followed by a cast of the returned value to the
appropriate function pointer type, and then it calls it.

* Menu:

* Dynamically registering methods::
* Forwarding hook::


File: llvm.info,  Node: Dynamically registering methods,  Next: Forwarding hook,  Up: Messaging with the GNU Objective-C runtime

8.10.1 Dynamically Registering Methods
--------------------------------------

If 'objc_msg_lookup()' does not find a suitable method implementation,
because the receiver does not implement the required method, it tries to
see if the class can dynamically register the method.

 To do so, the runtime checks if the class of the receiver implements
the method

     + (BOOL) resolveInstanceMethod: (SEL)selector;

 in the case of an instance method, or

     + (BOOL) resolveClassMethod: (SEL)selector;

 in the case of a class method.  If the class implements it, the runtime
invokes it, passing as argument the selector of the original method, and
if it returns 'YES', the runtime tries the lookup again, which could now
succeed if a matching method was added dynamically by
'+resolveInstanceMethod:' or '+resolveClassMethod:'.

 This allows classes to dynamically register methods (by adding them to
the class using 'class_addMethod') when they are first called.  To do
so, a class should implement '+resolveInstanceMethod:' (or, depending on
the case, '+resolveClassMethod:') and have it recognize the selectors of
methods that can be registered dynamically at runtime, register them,
and return 'YES'.  It should return 'NO' for methods that it does not
dynamically registered at runtime.

 If '+resolveInstanceMethod:' (or '+resolveClassMethod:') is not
implemented or returns 'NO', the runtime then tries the forwarding hook.

 Support for '+resolveInstanceMethod:' and 'resolveClassMethod:' was
added to the GNU Objective-C runtime in GCC version 4.6.


File: llvm.info,  Node: Forwarding hook,  Prev: Dynamically registering methods,  Up: Messaging with the GNU Objective-C runtime

8.10.2 Forwarding Hook
----------------------

The GNU Objective-C runtime provides a hook, called
'__objc_msg_forward2', which is called by 'objc_msg_lookup()' when it
can't find a method implementation in the runtime tables and after
calling '+resolveInstanceMethod:' and '+resolveClassMethod:' has been
attempted and did not succeed in dynamically registering the method.

 To configure the hook, you set the global variable
'__objc_msg_forward2' to a function with the same argument and return
types of 'objc_msg_lookup()'.  When 'objc_msg_lookup()' can not find a
method implementation, it invokes the hook function you provided to get
a method implementation to return.  So, in practice
'__objc_msg_forward2' allows you to extend 'objc_msg_lookup()' by adding
some custom code that is called to do a further lookup when no standard
method implementation can be found using the normal lookup.

 This hook is generally reserved for "Foundation" libraries such as
GNUstep Base, which use it to implement their high-level method
forwarding API, typically based around the 'forwardInvocation:' method.
So, unless you are implementing your own "Foundation" library, you
should not set this hook.

 In a typical forwarding implementation, the '__objc_msg_forward2' hook
function determines the argument and return type of the method that is
being looked up, and then creates a function that takes these arguments
and has that return type, and returns it to the caller.  Creating this
function is non-trivial and is typically performed using a dedicated
library such as 'libffi'.

 The forwarding method implementation thus created is returned by
'objc_msg_lookup()' and is executed as if it was a normal method
implementation.  When the forwarding method implementation is called, it
is usually expected to pack all arguments into some sort of object
(typically, an 'NSInvocation' in a "Foundation" library), and hand it
over to the programmer ('forwardInvocation:') who is then allowed to
manipulate the method invocation using a high-level API provided by the
"Foundation" library.  For example, the programmer may want to examine
the method invocation arguments and name and potentially change them
before forwarding the method invocation to one or more local objects
('performInvocation:') or even to remote objects (by using Distributed
Objects or some other mechanism).  When all this completes, the return
value is passed back and must be returned correctly to the original
caller.

 Note that the GNU Objective-C runtime currently provides no support for
method forwarding or method invocations other than the
'__objc_msg_forward2' hook.

 If the forwarding hook does not exist or returns 'NULL', the runtime
currently attempts forwarding using an older, deprecated API, and if
that fails, it aborts the program.  In future versions of the GNU
Objective-C runtime, the runtime will immediately abort.

9 Binary Compatibility
**********************

Binary compatibility encompasses several related concepts:

"application binary interface (ABI)"
     The set of runtime conventions followed by all of the tools that
     deal with binary representations of a program, including compilers,
     assemblers, linkers, and language runtime support.  Some ABIs are
     formal with a written specification, possibly designed by multiple
     interested parties.  Others are simply the way things are actually
     done by a particular set of tools.

"ABI conformance"
     A compiler conforms to an ABI if it generates code that follows all
     of the specifications enumerated by that ABI.  A library conforms
     to an ABI if it is implemented according to that ABI.  An
     application conforms to an ABI if it is built using tools that
     conform to that ABI and does not contain source code that
     specifically changes behavior specified by the ABI.

"calling conventions"
     Calling conventions are a subset of an ABI that specify of how
     arguments are passed and function results are returned.

"interoperability"
     Different sets of tools are interoperable if they generate files
     that can be used in the same program.  The set of tools includes
     compilers, assemblers, linkers, libraries, header files, startup
     files, and debuggers.  Binaries produced by different sets of tools
     are not interoperable unless they implement the same ABI.  This
     applies to different versions of the same tools as well as tools
     from different vendors.

"intercallability"
     Whether a function in a binary built by one set of tools can call a
     function in a binary built by a different set of tools is a subset
     of interoperability.

"implementation-defined features"
     Language standards include lists of implementation-defined features
     whose behavior can vary from one implementation to another.  Some
     of these features are normally covered by a platform's ABI and
     others are not.  The features that are not covered by an ABI
     generally affect how a program behaves, but not intercallability.

"compatibility"
     Conformance to the same ABI and the same behavior of
     implementation-defined features are both relevant for
     compatibility.

 The application binary interface implemented by a C or C++ compiler
affects code generation and runtime support for:

   * size and alignment of data types
   * layout of structured types
   * calling conventions
   * register usage conventions
   * interfaces for runtime arithmetic support
   * object file formats

 In addition, the application binary interface implemented by a C++
compiler affects code generation and runtime support for:
   * name mangling
   * exception handling
   * invoking constructors and destructors
   * layout, alignment, and padding of classes
   * layout and alignment of virtual tables

 Some GCC compilation options cause the compiler to generate code that
does not conform to the platform's default ABI.  Other options cause
different program behavior for implementation-defined features that are
not covered by an ABI.  These options are provided for consistency with
other compilers that do not follow the platform's default ABI or the
usual behavior of implementation-defined features for the platform.  Be
very careful about using such options.

 Most platforms have a well-defined ABI that covers C code, but ABIs
that cover C++ functionality are not yet common.

 Starting with GCC 3.2, GCC binary conventions for C++ are based on a
written, vendor-neutral C++ ABI that was designed to be specific to
64-bit Itanium but also includes generic specifications that apply to
any platform.  This C++ ABI is also implemented by other compiler
vendors on some platforms, notably GNU/Linux and BSD systems.  We have
tried hard to provide a stable ABI that will be compatible with future
GCC releases, but it is possible that we will encounter problems that
make this difficult.  Such problems could include different
interpretations of the C++ ABI by different vendors, bugs in the ABI, or
bugs in the implementation of the ABI in different compilers.  GCC's
'-Wabi' switch warns when G++ generates code that is probably not
compatible with the C++ ABI.

 The C++ library used with a C++ compiler includes the Standard C++
Library, with functionality defined in the C++ Standard, plus language
runtime support.  The runtime support is included in a C++ ABI, but
there is no formal ABI for the Standard C++ Library.  Two
implementations of that library are interoperable if one follows the
de-facto ABI of the other and if they are both built with the same
compiler, or with compilers that conform to the same ABI for C++
compiler and runtime support.

 When G++ and another C++ compiler conform to the same C++ ABI, but the
implementations of the Standard C++ Library that they normally use do
not follow the same ABI for the Standard C++ Library, object files built
with those compilers can be used in the same program only if they use
the same C++ library.  This requires specifying the location of the C++
library header files when invoking the compiler whose usual library is
not being used.  The location of GCC's C++ header files depends on how
the GCC build was configured, but can be seen by using the G++ '-v'
option.  With default configuration options for G++ 3.3 the compile line
for a different C++ compiler needs to include

         -IGCC_INSTALL_DIRECTORY/include/c++/3.3

 Similarly, compiling code with G++ that must use a C++ library other
than the GNU C++ library requires specifying the location of the header
files for that other library.

 The most straightforward way to link a program to use a particular C++
library is to use a C++ driver that specifies that C++ library by
default.  The 'g++' driver, for example, tells the linker where to find
GCC's C++ library ('libstdc++') plus the other libraries and startup
files it needs, in the proper order.

 If a program must use a different C++ library and it's not possible to
do the final link using a C++ driver that uses that library by default,
it is necessary to tell 'g++' the location and name of that library.  It
might also be necessary to specify different startup files and other
runtime support libraries, and to suppress the use of GCC's support
libraries with one or more of the options '-nostdlib', '-nostartfiles',
and '-nodefaultlibs'.

10.2 Interoperation
===================

This section lists various difficulties encountered in using GCC
together with other compilers or with the assemblers, linkers, libraries
and debuggers on certain systems.

   * On many platforms, GCC supports a different ABI for C++ than do
     other compilers, so the object files compiled by GCC cannot be used
     with object files generated by another C++ compiler.

     An area where the difference is most apparent is name mangling.
     The use of different name mangling is intentional, to protect you
     from more subtle problems.  Compilers differ as to many internal
     details of C++ implementation, including: how class instances are
     laid out, how multiple inheritance is implemented, and how virtual
     function calls are handled.  If the name encoding were made the
     same, your programs would link against libraries provided from
     other compilers--but the programs would then crash when run.
     Incompatible libraries are then detected at link time, rather than
     at run time.

   * On some BSD systems, including some versions of Ultrix, use of
     profiling causes static variable destructors (currently used only
     in C++) not to be run.

   * On a SPARC, GCC aligns all values of type 'double' on an 8-byte
     boundary, and it expects every 'double' to be so aligned.  The Sun
     compiler usually gives 'double' values 8-byte alignment, with one
     exception: function arguments of type 'double' may not be aligned.

     As a result, if a function compiled with Sun CC takes the address
     of an argument of type 'double' and passes this pointer of type
     'double *' to a function compiled with GCC, dereferencing the
     pointer may cause a fatal signal.

     One way to solve this problem is to compile your entire program
     with GCC.  Another solution is to modify the function that is
     compiled with Sun CC to copy the argument into a local variable;
     local variables are always properly aligned.  A third solution is
     to modify the function that uses the pointer to dereference it via
     the following function 'access_double' instead of directly with
     '*':

          inline double
          access_double (double *unaligned_ptr)
          {
            union d2i { double d; int i[2]; };

            union d2i *p = (union d2i *) unaligned_ptr;
            union d2i u;

            u.i[0] = p->i[0];
            u.i[1] = p->i[1];

            return u.d;
          }

     Storing into the pointer can be done likewise with the same union.

   * On Solaris, the 'malloc' function in the 'libmalloc.a' library may
     allocate memory that is only 4 byte aligned.  Since GCC on the
     SPARC assumes that doubles are 8 byte aligned, this may result in a
     fatal signal if doubles are stored in memory allocated by the
     'libmalloc.a' library.

     The solution is to not use the 'libmalloc.a' library.  Use instead
     'malloc' and related functions from 'libc.a'; they do not have this
     problem.

   * On the HP PA machine, ADB sometimes fails to work on functions
     compiled with GCC.  Specifically, it fails to work on functions
     that use 'alloca' or variable-size arrays.  This is because GCC
     doesn't generate HP-UX unwind descriptors for such functions.  It
     may even be impossible to generate them.

   * Debugging ('-g') is not supported on the HP PA machine, unless you
     use the preliminary GNU tools.

   * Taking the address of a label may generate errors from the HP-UX PA
     assembler.  GAS for the PA does not have this problem.

   * Using floating point parameters for indirect calls to static
     functions will not work when using the HP assembler.  There simply
     is no way for GCC to specify what registers hold arguments for
     static functions when using the HP assembler.  GAS for the PA does
     not have this problem.

   * In extremely rare cases involving some very large functions you may
     receive errors from the HP linker complaining about an out of
     bounds unconditional branch offset.  This used to occur more often
     in previous versions of GCC, but is now exceptionally rare.  If you
     should run into it, you can work around by making your function
     smaller.

   * GCC compiled code sometimes emits warnings from the HP-UX assembler
     of the form:

          (warning) Use of GR3 when
            frame >= 8192 may cause conflict.

     These warnings are harmless and can be safely ignored.

   * In extremely rare cases involving some very large functions you may
     receive errors from the AIX Assembler complaining about a
     displacement that is too large.  If you should run into it, you can
     work around by making your function smaller.

   * The 'libstdc++.a' library in GCC relies on the SVR4 dynamic linker
     semantics which merges global symbols between libraries and
     applications, especially necessary for C++ streams functionality.
     This is not the default behavior of AIX shared libraries and
     dynamic linking.  'libstdc++.a' is built on AIX with
     "runtime-linking" enabled so that symbol merging can occur.  To
     utilize this feature, the application linked with 'libstdc++.a'
     must include the '-Wl,-brtl' flag on the link line.  G++ cannot
     impose this because this option may interfere with the semantics of
     the user program and users may not always use 'g++' to link his or
     her application.  Applications are not required to use the
     '-Wl,-brtl' flag on the link line--the rest of the 'libstdc++.a'
     library which is not dependent on the symbol merging semantics will
     continue to function correctly.

   * An application can interpose its own definition of functions for
     functions invoked by 'libstdc++.a' with "runtime-linking" enabled
     on AIX.  To accomplish this the application must be linked with
     "runtime-linking" option and the functions explicitly must be
     exported by the application ('-Wl,-brtl,-bE:exportfile').

   * AIX on the RS/6000 provides support (NLS) for environments outside
     of the United States.  Compilers and assemblers use NLS to support
     locale-specific representations of various objects including
     floating-point numbers ('.' vs ',' for separating decimal
     fractions).  There have been problems reported where the library
     linked with GCC does not produce the same floating-point formats
     that the assembler accepts.  If you have this problem, set the
     'LANG' environment variable to 'C' or 'En_US'.

   * Even if you specify '-fdollars-in-identifiers', you cannot
     successfully use '$' in identifiers on the RS/6000 due to a
     restriction in the IBM assembler.  GAS supports these identifiers.

10.3 Incompatibilities of GCC
=============================

There are several noteworthy incompatibilities between GNU C and K&R
(non-ISO) versions of C.

   * GCC normally makes string constants read-only.  If several
     identical-looking string constants are used, GCC stores only one
     copy of the string.

     One consequence is that you cannot call 'mktemp' with a string
     constant argument.  The function 'mktemp' always alters the string
     its argument points to.

     Another consequence is that 'sscanf' does not work on some very old
     systems when passed a string constant as its format control string
     or input.  This is because 'sscanf' incorrectly tries to write into
     the string constant.  Likewise 'fscanf' and 'scanf'.

     The solution to these problems is to change the program to use
     'char'-array variables with initialization strings for these
     purposes instead of string constants.

   * '-2147483648' is positive.

     This is because 2147483648 cannot fit in the type 'int', so
     (following the ISO C rules) its data type is 'unsigned long int'.
     Negating this value yields 2147483648 again.

   * GCC does not substitute macro arguments when they appear inside of
     string constants.  For example, the following macro in GCC

          #define foo(a) "a"

     will produce output '"a"' regardless of what the argument A is.

   * When you use 'setjmp' and 'longjmp', the only automatic variables
     guaranteed to remain valid are those declared 'volatile'.  This is
     a consequence of automatic register allocation.  Consider this
     function:

          jmp_buf j;

          foo ()
          {
            int a, b;

            a = fun1 ();
            if (setjmp (j))
              return a;

            a = fun2 ();
            /* 'longjmp (j)' may occur in 'fun3'. */
            return a + fun3 ();
          }

     Here 'a' may or may not be restored to its first value when the
     'longjmp' occurs.  If 'a' is allocated in a register, then its
     first value is restored; otherwise, it keeps the last value stored
     in it.

     If you use the '-W' option with the '-O' option, you will get a
     warning when GCC thinks such a problem might be possible.

   * Programs that use preprocessing directives in the middle of macro
     arguments do not work with GCC.  For example, a program like this
     will not work:

          foobar (
          #define luser
                  hack)

     ISO C does not permit such a construct.

   * K&R compilers allow comments to cross over an inclusion boundary
     (i.e. started in an include file and ended in the including file).

   * Declarations of external variables and functions within a block
     apply only to the block containing the declaration.  In other
     words, they have the same scope as any other declaration in the
     same place.

     In some other C compilers, an 'extern' declaration affects all the
     rest of the file even if it happens within a block.

   * In traditional C, you can combine 'long', etc., with a typedef
     name, as shown here:

          typedef int foo;
          typedef long foo bar;

     In ISO C, this is not allowed: 'long' and other type modifiers
     require an explicit 'int'.

   * PCC allows typedef names to be used as function parameters.

   * Traditional C allows the following erroneous pair of declarations
     to appear together in a given scope:

          typedef int foo;
          typedef foo foo;

   * GCC treats all characters of identifiers as significant.  According
     to K&R-1 (2.2), "No more than the first eight characters are
     significant, although more may be used.".  Also according to K&R-1
     (2.2), "An identifier is a sequence of letters and digits; the
     first character must be a letter.  The underscore _ counts as a
     letter.", but GCC also allows dollar signs in identifiers.

   * PCC allows whitespace in the middle of compound assignment
     operators such as '+='.  GCC, following the ISO standard, does not
     allow this.

   * GCC complains about unterminated character constants inside of
     preprocessing conditionals that fail.  Some programs have English
     comments enclosed in conditionals that are guaranteed to fail; if
     these comments contain apostrophes, GCC will probably report an
     error.  For example, this code would produce an error:

          #if 0
          You can't expect this to work.
          #endif

     The best solution to such a problem is to put the text into an
     actual C comment delimited by '/*...*/'.

   * Many user programs contain the declaration 'long time ();'.  In the
     past, the system header files on many systems did not actually
     declare 'time', so it did not matter what type your program
     declared it to return.  But in systems with ISO C headers, 'time'
     is declared to return 'time_t', and if that is not the same as
     'long', then 'long time ();' is erroneous.

     The solution is to change your program to use appropriate system
     headers ('<time.h>' on systems with ISO C headers) and not to
     declare 'time' if the system header files declare it, or failing
     that to use 'time_t' as the return type of 'time'.

   * When compiling functions that return 'float', PCC converts it to a
     double.  GCC actually returns a 'float'.  If you are concerned with
     PCC compatibility, you should declare your functions to return
     'double'; you might as well say what you mean.

   * When compiling functions that return structures or unions, GCC
     output code normally uses a method different from that used on most
     versions of Unix.  As a result, code compiled with GCC cannot call
     a structure-returning function compiled with PCC, and vice versa.

     The method used by GCC is as follows: a structure or union which is
     1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes long is returned like a scalar.  A structure or
     union with any other size is stored into an address supplied by the
     caller (usually in a special, fixed register, but on some machines
     it is passed on the stack).  The target hook
     'TARGET_STRUCT_VALUE_RTX' tells GCC where to pass this address.

     By contrast, PCC on most target machines returns structures and
     unions of any size by copying the data into an area of static
     storage, and then returning the address of that storage as if it
     were a pointer value.  The caller must copy the data from that
     memory area to the place where the value is wanted.  GCC does not
     use this method because it is slower and nonreentrant.

     On some newer machines, PCC uses a reentrant convention for all
     structure and union returning.  GCC on most of these machines uses
     a compatible convention when returning structures and unions in
     memory, but still returns small structures and unions in registers.

     You can tell GCC to use a compatible convention for all structure
     and union returning with the option '-fpcc-struct-return'.

   * GCC complains about program fragments such as '0x74ae-0x4000' which
     appear to be two hexadecimal constants separated by the minus
     operator.  Actually, this string is a single "preprocessing token".
     Each such token must correspond to one token in C.  Since this does
     not, GCC prints an error message.  Although it may appear obvious
     that what is meant is an operator and two values, the ISO C
     standard specifically requires that this be treated as erroneous.

     A "preprocessing token" is a "preprocessing number" if it begins
     with a digit and is followed by letters, underscores, digits,
     periods and 'e+', 'e-', 'E+', 'E-', 'p+', 'p-', 'P+', or 'P-'
     character sequences.  (In strict C90 mode, the sequences 'p+',
     'p-', 'P+' and 'P-' cannot appear in preprocessing numbers.)

     To make the above program fragment valid, place whitespace in front
     of the minus sign.  This whitespace will end the preprocessing
     number.

10.4 Fixed Header Files
=======================

GCC needs to install corrected versions of some system header files.
This is because most target systems have some header files that won't
work with GCC unless they are changed.  Some have bugs, some are
incompatible with ISO C, and some depend on special features of other
compilers.

 Installing GCC automatically creates and installs the fixed header
files, by running a program called 'fixincludes'.  Normally, you don't
need to pay attention to this.  But there are cases where it doesn't do
the right thing automatically.

   * If you update the system's header files, such as by installing a
     new system version, the fixed header files of GCC are not
     automatically updated.  They can be updated using the 'mkheaders'
     script installed in 'LIBEXECDIR/gcc/TARGET/VERSION/install-tools/'.

   * On some systems, header file directories contain machine-specific
     symbolic links in certain places.  This makes it possible to share
     most of the header files among hosts running the same version of
     the system on different machine models.

     The programs that fix the header files do not understand this
     special way of using symbolic links; therefore, the directory of
     fixed header files is good only for the machine model used to build
     it.

     It is possible to make separate sets of fixed header files for the
     different machine models, and arrange a structure of symbolic links
     so as to use the proper set, but you'll have to do this by hand.


File: llvm.info,  Node: Standard Libraries,  Next: Disappointments,  Prev: Fixed Headers,  Up: Trouble

10.5 Standard Libraries
=======================

GCC by itself attempts to be a conforming freestanding implementation.
*Note Language Standards Supported by GCC: Standards, for details of
what this means.  Beyond the library facilities required of such an
implementation, the rest of the C library is supplied by the vendor of
the operating system.  If that C library doesn't conform to the C
standards, then your programs might get warnings (especially when using
'-Wall') that you don't expect.

 For example, the 'sprintf' function on SunOS 4.1.3 returns 'char *'
while the C standard says that 'sprintf' returns an 'int'.  The
'fixincludes' program could make the prototype for this function match
the Standard, but that would be wrong, since the function will still
return 'char *'.

 If you need a Standard compliant library, then you need to find one, as
GCC does not provide one.  The GNU C library (called 'glibc') provides
ISO C, POSIX, BSD, SystemV and X/Open compatibility for GNU/Linux and
HURD-based GNU systems; no recent version of it supports other systems,
though some very old versions did.  Version 2.2 of the GNU C library
includes nearly complete C99 support.  You could also ask your operating
system vendor if newer libraries are available.


File: llvm.info,  Node: Disappointments,  Next: C++ Misunderstandings,  Prev: Standard Libraries,  Up: Trouble

10.6 Disappointments and Misunderstandings
==========================================

These problems are perhaps regrettable, but we don't know any practical
way around them.

   * Certain local variables aren't recognized by debuggers when you
     compile with optimization.

     This occurs because sometimes GCC optimizes the variable out of
     existence.  There is no way to tell the debugger how to compute the
     value such a variable "would have had", and it is not clear that
     would be desirable anyway.  So GCC simply does not mention the
     eliminated variable when it writes debugging information.

     You have to expect a certain amount of disagreement between the
     executable and your source code, when you use optimization.

   * Users often think it is a bug when GCC reports an error for code
     like this:

          int foo (struct mumble *);

          struct mumble { ... };

          int foo (struct mumble *x)
          { ... }

     This code really is erroneous, because the scope of 'struct mumble'
     in the prototype is limited to the argument list containing it.  It
     does not refer to the 'struct mumble' defined with file scope
     immediately below--they are two unrelated types with similar names
     in different scopes.

     But in the definition of 'foo', the file-scope type is used because
     that is available to be inherited.  Thus, the definition and the
     prototype do not match, and you get an error.

     This behavior may seem silly, but it's what the ISO standard
     specifies.  It is easy enough for you to make your code work by
     moving the definition of 'struct mumble' above the prototype.  It's
     not worth being incompatible with ISO C just to avoid an error for
     the example shown above.

   * Accesses to bit-fields even in volatile objects works by accessing
     larger objects, such as a byte or a word.  You cannot rely on what
     size of object is accessed in order to read or write the bit-field;
     it may even vary for a given bit-field according to the precise
     usage.

     If you care about controlling the amount of memory that is
     accessed, use volatile but do not use bit-fields.

   * GCC comes with shell scripts to fix certain known problems in
     system header files.  They install corrected copies of various
     header files in a special directory where only GCC will normally
     look for them.  The scripts adapt to various systems by searching
     all the system header files for the problem cases that we know
     about.

     If new system header files are installed, nothing automatically
     arranges to update the corrected header files.  They can be updated
     using the 'mkheaders' script installed in
     'LIBEXECDIR/gcc/TARGET/VERSION/install-tools/'.

   * On 68000 and x86 systems, for instance, you can get paradoxical
     results if you test the precise values of floating point numbers.
     For example, you can find that a floating point value which is not
     a NaN is not equal to itself.  This results from the fact that the
     floating point registers hold a few more bits of precision than fit
     in a 'double' in memory.  Compiled code moves values between memory
     and floating point registers at its convenience, and moving them
     into memory truncates them.

     You can partially avoid this problem by using the '-ffloat-store'
     option (*note Optimize Options::).

   * On AIX and other platforms without weak symbol support, templates
     need to be instantiated explicitly and symbols for static members
     of templates will not be generated.

   * On AIX, GCC scans object files and library archives for static
     constructors and destructors when linking an application before the
     linker prunes unreferenced symbols.  This is necessary to prevent
     the AIX linker from mistakenly assuming that static constructor or
     destructor are unused and removing them before the scanning can
     occur.  All static constructors and destructors found will be
     referenced even though the modules in which they occur may not be
     used by the program.  This may lead to both increased executable
     size and unexpected symbol references.

10.7 Common Misunderstandings with GNU C++
==========================================

C++ is a complex language and an evolving one, and its standard
definition (the ISO C++ standard) was only recently completed.  As a
result, your C++ compiler may occasionally surprise you, even when its
behavior is correct.  This section discusses some areas that frequently
give rise to questions of this sort.

* Menu:

* Static Definitions::  Static member declarations are not definitions
* Name lookup::         Name lookup, templates, and accessing members of base classes
* Temporaries::         Temporaries may vanish before you expect
* Copy Assignment::     Copy Assignment operators copy virtual bases twice


File: llvm.info,  Node: Static Definitions,  Next: Name lookup,  Up: C++ Misunderstandings

10.7.1 Declare _and_ Define Static Members
------------------------------------------

When a class has static data members, it is not enough to _declare_ the
static member; you must also _define_ it.  For example:

     class Foo
     {
       ...
       void method();
       static int bar;
     };

 This declaration only establishes that the class 'Foo' has an 'int'
named 'Foo::bar', and a member function named 'Foo::method'.  But you
still need to define _both_ 'method' and 'bar' elsewhere.  According to
the ISO standard, you must supply an initializer in one (and only one)
source file, such as:

     int Foo::bar = 0;

 Other C++ compilers may not correctly implement the standard behavior.
As a result, when you switch to 'g++' from one of these compilers, you
may discover that a program that appeared to work correctly in fact does
not conform to the standard: 'g++' reports as undefined symbols any
static data members that lack definitions.


File: llvm.info,  Node: Name lookup,  Next: Temporaries,  Prev: Static Definitions,  Up: C++ Misunderstandings

10.7.2 Name Lookup, Templates, and Accessing Members of Base Classes
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The C++ standard prescribes that all names that are not dependent on
template parameters are bound to their present definitions when parsing
a template function or class.(1)  Only names that are dependent are
looked up at the point of instantiation.  For example, consider

       void foo(double);

       struct A {
         template <typename T>
         void f () {
           foo (1);        // 1
           int i = N;      // 2
           T t;
           t.bar();        // 3
           foo (t);        // 4
         }

         static const int N;
       };

 Here, the names 'foo' and 'N' appear in a context that does not depend
on the type of 'T'.  The compiler will thus require that they are
defined in the context of use in the template, not only before the point
of instantiation, and will here use '::foo(double)' and 'A::N',
respectively.  In particular, it will convert the integer value to a
'double' when passing it to '::foo(double)'.

 Conversely, 'bar' and the call to 'foo' in the fourth marked line are
used in contexts that do depend on the type of 'T', so they are only
looked up at the point of instantiation, and you can provide
declarations for them after declaring the template, but before
instantiating it.  In particular, if you instantiate 'A::f<int>', the
last line will call an overloaded '::foo(int)' if one was provided, even
if after the declaration of 'struct A'.

 This distinction between lookup of dependent and non-dependent names is
called two-stage (or dependent) name lookup.  G++ implements it since
version 3.4.

 Two-stage name lookup sometimes leads to situations with behavior
different from non-template codes.  The most common is probably this:

       template <typename T> struct Base {
         int i;
       };

       template <typename T> struct Derived : public Base<T> {
         int get_i() { return i; }
       };

 In 'get_i()', 'i' is not used in a dependent context, so the compiler
will look for a name declared at the enclosing namespace scope (which is
the global scope here).  It will not look into the base class, since
that is dependent and you may declare specializations of 'Base' even
after declaring 'Derived', so the compiler can't really know what 'i'
would refer to.  If there is no global variable 'i', then you will get
an error message.

 In order to make it clear that you want the member of the base class,
you need to defer lookup until instantiation time, at which the base
class is known.  For this, you need to access 'i' in a dependent
context, by either using 'this->i' (remember that 'this' is of type
'Derived<T>*', so is obviously dependent), or using 'Base<T>::i'.
Alternatively, 'Base<T>::i' might be brought into scope by a
'using'-declaration.

 Another, similar example involves calling member functions of a base
class:

       template <typename T> struct Base {
           int f();
       };

       template <typename T> struct Derived : Base<T> {
           int g() { return f(); };
       };

 Again, the call to 'f()' is not dependent on template arguments (there
are no arguments that depend on the type 'T', and it is also not
otherwise specified that the call should be in a dependent context).
Thus a global declaration of such a function must be available, since
the one in the base class is not visible until instantiation time.  The
compiler will consequently produce the following error message:

       x.cc: In member function `int Derived<T>::g()':
       x.cc:6: error: there are no arguments to `f' that depend on a template
          parameter, so a declaration of `f' must be available
       x.cc:6: error: (if you use `-fpermissive', G++ will accept your code, but
          allowing the use of an undeclared name is deprecated)

 To make the code valid either use 'this->f()', or 'Base<T>::f()'.
Using the '-fpermissive' flag will also let the compiler accept the
code, by marking all function calls for which no declaration is visible
at the time of definition of the template for later lookup at
instantiation time, as if it were a dependent call.  We do not recommend
using '-fpermissive' to work around invalid code, and it will also only
catch cases where functions in base classes are called, not where
variables in base classes are used (as in the example above).

 Note that some compilers (including G++ versions prior to 3.4) get
these examples wrong and accept above code without an error.  Those
compilers do not implement two-stage name lookup correctly.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The C++ standard just uses the term "dependent" for names that
depend on the type or value of template parameters.  This shorter term

10.7.3 Temporaries May Vanish Before You Expect
-----------------------------------------------

It is dangerous to use pointers or references to _portions_ of a
temporary object.  The compiler may very well delete the object before
you expect it to, leaving a pointer to garbage.  The most common place
where this problem crops up is in classes like string classes,
especially ones that define a conversion function to type 'char *' or
'const char *'--which is one reason why the standard 'string' class
requires you to call the 'c_str' member function.  However, any class
that returns a pointer to some internal structure is potentially subject
to this problem.

 For example, a program may use a function 'strfunc' that returns
'string' objects, and another function 'charfunc' that operates on
pointers to 'char':

     string strfunc ();
     void charfunc (const char *);

     void
     f ()
     {
       const char *p = strfunc().c_str();
       ...
       charfunc (p);
       ...
       charfunc (p);
     }

In this situation, it may seem reasonable to save a pointer to the C
string returned by the 'c_str' member function and use that rather than
call 'c_str' repeatedly.  However, the temporary string created by the
call to 'strfunc' is destroyed after 'p' is initialized, at which point
'p' is left pointing to freed memory.

 Code like this may run successfully under some other compilers,
particularly obsolete cfront-based compilers that delete temporaries
along with normal local variables.  However, the GNU C++ behavior is
standard-conforming, so if your program depends on late destruction of
temporaries it is not portable.

 The safe way to write such code is to give the temporary a name, which
forces it to remain until the end of the scope of the name.  For
example:

     const string& tmp = strfunc ();
     charfunc (tmp.c_str ());

10.7.4 Implicit Copy-Assignment for Virtual Bases
-------------------------------------------------

When a base class is virtual, only one subobject of the base class
belongs to each full object.  Also, the constructors and destructors are
invoked only once, and called from the most-derived class.  However,
such objects behave unspecified when being assigned.  For example:

     struct Base{
       char *name;
       Base(char *n) : name(strdup(n)){}
       Base& operator= (const Base& other){
        free (name);
        name = strdup (other.name);
       }
     };

     struct A:virtual Base{
       int val;
       A():Base("A"){}
     };

     struct B:virtual Base{
       int bval;
       B():Base("B"){}
     };

     struct Derived:public A, public B{
       Derived():Base("Derived"){}
     };

     void func(Derived &d1, Derived &d2)
     {
       d1 = d2;
     }

 The C++ standard specifies that 'Base::Base' is only called once when
constructing or copy-constructing a Derived object.  It is unspecified
whether 'Base::operator=' is called more than once when the implicit
copy-assignment for Derived objects is invoked (as it is inside 'func'
in the example).

 G++ implements the "intuitive" algorithm for copy-assignment: assign
all direct bases, then assign all members.  In that algorithm, the
virtual base subobject can be encountered more than once.  In the
example, copying proceeds in the following order: 'val', 'name' (via
'strdup'), 'bval', and 'name' again.

 If application code relies on copy-assignment, a user-defined
copy-assignment operator removes any uncertainties.  With such an
operator, the application can define whether and how the virtual base
subobject is assigned.

10.8 Certain Changes We Don't Want to Make
==========================================

This section lists changes that people frequently request, but which we
do not make because we think GCC is better without them.

   * Checking the number and type of arguments to a function which has
     an old-fashioned definition and no prototype.

     Such a feature would work only occasionally--only for calls that
     appear in the same file as the called function, following the
     definition.  The only way to check all calls reliably is to add a
     prototype for the function.  But adding a prototype eliminates the
     motivation for this feature.  So the feature is not worthwhile.

   * Warning about using an expression whose type is signed as a shift
     count.

     Shift count operands are probably signed more often than unsigned.
     Warning about this would cause far more annoyance than good.

   * Warning about assigning a signed value to an unsigned variable.

     Such assignments must be very common; warning about them would
     cause more annoyance than good.

   * Warning when a non-void function value is ignored.

     C contains many standard functions that return a value that most
     programs choose to ignore.  One obvious example is 'printf'.
     Warning about this practice only leads the defensive programmer to
     clutter programs with dozens of casts to 'void'.  Such casts are
     required so frequently that they become visual noise.  Writing
     those casts becomes so automatic that they no longer convey useful
     information about the intentions of the programmer.  For functions
     where the return value should never be ignored, use the
     'warn_unused_result' function attribute (*note Function
     Attributes::).

   * Making '-fshort-enums' the default.

     This would cause storage layout to be incompatible with most other
     C compilers.  And it doesn't seem very important, given that you
     can get the same result in other ways.  The case where it matters
     most is when the enumeration-valued object is inside a structure,
     and in that case you can specify a field width explicitly.

   * Making bit-fields unsigned by default on particular machines where
     "the ABI standard" says to do so.

     The ISO C standard leaves it up to the implementation whether a
     bit-field declared plain 'int' is signed or not.  This in effect
     creates two alternative dialects of C.

     The GNU C compiler supports both dialects; you can specify the
     signed dialect with '-fsigned-bitfields' and the unsigned dialect
     with '-funsigned-bitfields'.  However, this leaves open the
     question of which dialect to use by default.

     Currently, the preferred dialect makes plain bit-fields signed,
     because this is simplest.  Since 'int' is the same as 'signed int'
     in every other context, it is cleanest for them to be the same in
     bit-fields as well.

     Some computer manufacturers have published Application Binary
     Interface standards which specify that plain bit-fields should be
     unsigned.  It is a mistake, however, to say anything about this
     issue in an ABI.  This is because the handling of plain bit-fields
     distinguishes two dialects of C.  Both dialects are meaningful on
     every type of machine.  Whether a particular object file was
     compiled using signed bit-fields or unsigned is of no concern to
     other object files, even if they access the same bit-fields in the
     same data structures.

     A given program is written in one or the other of these two
     dialects.  The program stands a chance to work on most any machine
     if it is compiled with the proper dialect.  It is unlikely to work
     at all if compiled with the wrong dialect.

     Many users appreciate the GNU C compiler because it provides an
     environment that is uniform across machines.  These users would be
     inconvenienced if the compiler treated plain bit-fields differently
     on certain machines.

     Occasionally users write programs intended only for a particular
     machine type.  On these occasions, the users would benefit if the
     GNU C compiler were to support by default the same dialect as the
     other compilers on that machine.  But such applications are rare.
     And users writing a program to run on more than one type of machine
     cannot possibly benefit from this kind of compatibility.

     This is why GCC does and will treat plain bit-fields in the same
     fashion on all types of machines (by default).

     There are some arguments for making bit-fields unsigned by default
     on all machines.  If, for example, this becomes a universal de
     facto standard, it would make sense for GCC to go along with it.
     This is something to be considered in the future.

     (Of course, users strongly concerned about portability should
     indicate explicitly in each bit-field whether it is signed or not.
     In this way, they write programs which have the same meaning in
     both C dialects.)

   * Undefining '__STDC__' when '-ansi' is not used.

     Currently, GCC defines '__STDC__' unconditionally.  This provides
     good results in practice.

     Programmers normally use conditionals on '__STDC__' to ask whether
     it is safe to use certain features of ISO C, such as function
     prototypes or ISO token concatenation.  Since plain 'gcc' supports
     all the features of ISO C, the correct answer to these questions is
     "yes".

     Some users try to use '__STDC__' to check for the availability of
     certain library facilities.  This is actually incorrect usage in an
     ISO C program, because the ISO C standard says that a conforming
     freestanding implementation should define '__STDC__' even though it
     does not have the library facilities.  'gcc -ansi -pedantic' is a
     conforming freestanding implementation, and it is therefore
     required to define '__STDC__', even though it does not come with an
     ISO C library.

     Sometimes people say that defining '__STDC__' in a compiler that
     does not completely conform to the ISO C standard somehow violates
     the standard.  This is illogical.  The standard is a standard for
     compilers that claim to support ISO C, such as 'gcc -ansi'--not for
     other compilers such as plain 'gcc'.  Whatever the ISO C standard
     says is relevant to the design of plain 'gcc' without '-ansi' only
     for pragmatic reasons, not as a requirement.

     GCC normally defines '__STDC__' to be 1, and in addition defines
     '__STRICT_ANSI__' if you specify the '-ansi' option, or a '-std'
     option for strict conformance to some version of ISO C.  On some
     hosts, system include files use a different convention, where
     '__STDC__' is normally 0, but is 1 if the user specifies strict
     conformance to the C Standard.  GCC follows the host convention
     when processing system include files, but when processing user
     files it follows the usual GNU C convention.

   * Undefining '__STDC__' in C++.

     Programs written to compile with C++-to-C translators get the value
     of '__STDC__' that goes with the C compiler that is subsequently
     used.  These programs must test '__STDC__' to determine what kind
     of C preprocessor that compiler uses: whether they should
     concatenate tokens in the ISO C fashion or in the traditional
     fashion.

     These programs work properly with GNU C++ if '__STDC__' is defined.
     They would not work otherwise.

     In addition, many header files are written to provide prototypes in
     ISO C but not in traditional C.  Many of these header files can
     work without change in C++ provided '__STDC__' is defined.  If
     '__STDC__' is not defined, they will all fail, and will all need to
     be changed to test explicitly for C++ as well.

   * Deleting "empty" loops.

     Historically, GCC has not deleted "empty" loops under the
     assumption that the most likely reason you would put one in a
     program is to have a delay, so deleting them will not make real
     programs run any faster.

     However, the rationale here is that optimization of a nonempty loop
     cannot produce an empty one.  This held for carefully written C
     compiled with less powerful optimizers but is not always the case
     for carefully written C++ or with more powerful optimizers.  Thus
     GCC will remove operations from loops whenever it can determine
     those operations are not externally visible (apart from the time
     taken to execute them, of course).  In case the loop can be proved
     to be finite, GCC will also remove the loop itself.

     Be aware of this when performing timing tests, for instance the
     following loop can be completely removed, provided
     'some_expression' can provably not change any global state.

          {
             int sum = 0;
             int ix;

             for (ix = 0; ix != 10000; ix++)
                sum += some_expression;
          }

     Even though 'sum' is accumulated in the loop, no use is made of
     that summation, so the accumulation can be removed.

   * Making side effects happen in the same order as in some other
     compiler.

     It is never safe to depend on the order of evaluation of side
     effects.  For example, a function call like this may very well
     behave differently from one compiler to another:

          void func (int, int);

          int i = 2;
          func (i++, i++);

     There is no guarantee (in either the C or the C++ standard language
     definitions) that the increments will be evaluated in any
     particular order.  Either increment might happen first.  'func'
     might get the arguments '2, 3', or it might get '3, 2', or even '2,
     2'.

   * Making certain warnings into errors by default.

     Some ISO C testsuites report failure when the compiler does not
     produce an error message for a certain program.

     ISO C requires a "diagnostic" message for certain kinds of invalid
     programs, but a warning is defined by GCC to count as a diagnostic.
     If GCC produces a warning but not an error, that is correct ISO C
     support.  If testsuites call this "failure", they should be run
     with the GCC option '-pedantic-errors', which will turn these
     warnings into errors.

10.9 Warning Messages and Error Messages
========================================

The GNU compiler can produce two kinds of diagnostics: errors and
warnings.  Each kind has a different purpose:

     "Errors" report problems that make it impossible to compile your
     program.  GCC reports errors with the source file name and line
     number where the problem is apparent.

     "Warnings" report other unusual conditions in your code that _may_
     indicate a problem, although compilation can (and does) proceed.
     Warning messages also report the source file name and line number,
     but include the text 'warning:' to distinguish them from error
     messages.

 Warnings may indicate danger points where you should check to make sure
that your program really does what you intend; or the use of obsolete
features; or the use of nonstandard features of GNU C or C++.  Many
warnings are issued only if you ask for them, with one of the '-W'
options (for instance, '-Wall' requests a variety of useful warnings).

 GCC always tries to compile your program if possible; it never
gratuitously rejects a program whose meaning is clear merely because
(for instance) it fails to conform to a standard.  In some cases,
however, the C and C++ standards specify that certain extensions are
forbidden, and a diagnostic _must_ be issued by a conforming compiler.
The '-pedantic' option tells GCC to issue warnings in such cases;
'-pedantic-errors' says to make them errors instead.  This does not mean
that _all_ non-ISO constructs get warnings or errors.

more detail on these and related command-line options.

File: llvm.info,  Node: Bug Criteria,  Next: Bug Reporting,  Up: Bugs

11.1 Have You Found a Bug?
==========================

If you are not sure whether you have found a bug, here are some
guidelines:

   * If the compiler gets a fatal signal, for any input whatever, that
     is a compiler bug.  Reliable compilers never crash.

   * If the compiler produces invalid assembly code, for any input
     whatever (except an 'asm' statement), that is a compiler bug,
     unless the compiler reports errors (not just warnings) which would
     ordinarily prevent the assembler from being run.

   * If the compiler produces valid assembly code that does not
     correctly execute the input source code, that is a compiler bug.

     However, you must double-check to make sure, because you may have a
     program whose behavior is undefined, which happened by chance to
     give the desired results with another C or C++ compiler.

     For example, in many nonoptimizing compilers, you can write 'x;' at
     the end of a function instead of 'return x;', with the same
     results.  But the value of the function is undefined if 'return' is
     omitted; it is not a bug when GCC produces different results.

     Problems often result from expressions with two increment
     operators, as in 'f (*p++, *p++)'.  Your previous compiler might
     have interpreted that expression the way you intended; GCC might
     interpret it another way.  Neither compiler is wrong.  The bug is
     in your code.

     After you have localized the error to a single source line, it
     should be easy to check for these things.  If your program is
     correct and well defined, you have found a compiler bug.

   * If the compiler produces an error message for valid input, that is
     a compiler bug.

   * If the compiler does not produce an error message for invalid
     input, that is a compiler bug.  However, you should note that your
     idea of "invalid input" might be someone else's idea of "an
     extension" or "support for traditional practice".

   * If you are an experienced user of one of the languages GCC
     supports, your suggestions for improvement of GCC are welcome in
     any case.

Funding Free Software
*********************

If you want to have more free software a few years from now, it makes
sense for you to help encourage people to contribute funds for its
development.  The most effective approach known is to encourage
commercial redistributors to donate.

 Users of free software systems can boost the pace of development by
encouraging for-a-fee distributors to donate part of their selling price
to free software developers--the Free Software Foundation, and others.

 The way to convince distributors to do this is to demand it and expect
it from them.  So when you compare distributors, judge them partly by
how much they give to free software development.  Show distributors they
must compete to be the one who gives the most.

 To make this approach work, you must insist on numbers that you can
compare, such as, "We will donate ten dollars to the Frobnitz project
for each disk sold."  Don't be satisfied with a vague promise, such as
"A portion of the profits are donated," since it doesn't give a basis
for comparison.

 Even a precise fraction "of the profits from this disk" is not very
meaningful, since creative accounting and unrelated business decisions
can greatly alter what fraction of the sales price counts as profit.  If
the price you pay is $50, ten percent of the profit is probably less
than a dollar; it might be a few cents, or nothing at all.

 Some redistributors do development work themselves.  This is useful
too; but to keep everyone honest, you need to inquire how much they do,
and what kind.  Some kinds of development make much more long-term
difference than others.  For example, maintaining a separate version of
a program contributes very little; maintaining the standard version of a
program for the whole community contributes much.  Easy new ports
contribute little, since someone else would surely do them; difficult
ports such as adding a new CPU to the GNU Compiler Collection contribute
more; major new features or packages contribute the most.

 By establishing the idea that supporting further development is "the
proper thing to do" when distributing free software for a fee, we can
assure a steady flow of resources into making more free software.
