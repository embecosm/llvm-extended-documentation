6.58.20 PowerPC AltiVec Built-in Functions
------------------------------------------

GCC provides an interface for the PowerPC family of processors to access
the AltiVec operations described in Motorola's AltiVec Programming
Interface Manual.  The interface is made available by including
`<altivec.h>' and using `-maltivec' and `-mabi=altivec'.  The interface
supports the following vector types.

     vector unsigned char
     vector signed char
     vector bool char

     vector unsigned short
     vector signed short
     vector bool short
     vector pixel

     vector unsigned int
     vector signed int
     vector bool int
     vector float

 If `-mvsx' is used the following additional vector types are
implemented.

     vector unsigned long
     vector signed long
     vector double

 The long types are only implemented for 64-bit code generation, and
the long type is only used in the floating point/integer conversion
instructions.

 GCC's implementation of the high-level language interface available
from C and C++ code differs from Motorola's documentation in several
ways.

   * A vector constant is a list of constant expressions within curly
     braces.

   * A vector initializer requires no cast if the vector constant is of
     the same type as the variable it is initializing.

   * If `signed' or `unsigned' is omitted, the signedness of the vector
     type is the default signedness of the base type.  The default
     varies depending on the operating system, so a portable program
     should always specify the signedness.

   * Compiling with `-maltivec' adds keywords `__vector', `vector',
     `__pixel', `pixel', `__bool' and `bool'.  When compiling ISO C,
     the context-sensitive substitution of the keywords `vector',
     `pixel' and `bool' is disabled.  To use them, you must include
     `<altivec.h>' instead.

   * GCC allows using a `typedef' name as the type specifier for a
     vector type.

   * For C, overloaded functions are implemented with macros so the
     following does not work:

            vec_add ((vector signed int){1, 2, 3, 4}, foo);

     Since `vec_add' is a macro, the vector constant in the example is
     treated as four separate arguments.  Wrap the entire argument in
     parentheses for this to work.

 _Note:_ Only the `<altivec.h>' interface is supported.  Internally,
GCC uses built-in functions to achieve the functionality in the
aforementioned header file, but they are not supported and are subject
to change without notice.

 The following interfaces are supported for the generic and specific
AltiVec operations and the AltiVec predicates.  In cases where there is
a direct mapping between generic and specific operations, only the
generic names are shown here, although the specific operations can also
be used.

 Arguments that are documented as `const int' require literal integral
values within the range required for that operation.

 Note that the `vec_ld' and `vec_st' built-in functions always generate
the AltiVec `LVX' and `STVX' instructions even if the VSX instruction
set is available.  The `vec_vsx_ld' and `vec_vsx_st' built-in functions
always generate the VSX `LXVD2X', `LXVW4X', `STXVD2X', and `STXVW4X'
instructions.

 If the ISA 2.07 additions to the vector/scalar (power8-vector)
instruction set is available, the following additional functions are
available for both 32-bit and 64-bit targets.  For 64-bit targets, you
can use VECTOR LONG instead of VECTOR LONG LONG, VECTOR BOOL LONG
instead of VECTOR BOOL LONG LONG, and VECTOR UNSIGNED LONG instead of
VECTOR UNSIGNED LONG LONG.

 If the ISA 2.07 additions to the vector/scalar (power8-vector)
instruction set is available, the following additional functions are
available for 64-bit targets.  New vector types (VECTOR __INT128_T and

__UINT128_T types to use these builtins.

 The normal vector extract, and set operations work on VECTOR
__INT128_T and VECTOR __UINT128_T types, but the index value must be 0.

6.58.21 PowerPC Hardware Transactional Memory Built-in Functions
----------------------------------------------------------------

GCC provides two interfaces for accessing the Hardware Transactional
Memory (HTM) instructions available on some of the PowerPC family of
processors (eg, POWER8).  The two interfaces come in a low level
interface, consisting of built-in functions specific to PowerPC and a
higher level interface consisting of inline functions that are common
between PowerPC and S/390.

6.58.21.1 PowerPC HTM Low Level Built-in Functions
..................................................

The following low level built-in functions are available with `-mhtm'
or `-mcpu=CPU' where CPU is `power8' or later.  They all generate the
machine instruction that is part of the name.

 The HTM built-ins return true or false depending on their success and
their arguments match exactly the type and order of the associated
hardware instruction's operands.  Refer to the ISA manual for a
description of each instruction's operands.

     unsigned int __builtin_tbegin (unsigned int)
     unsigned int __builtin_tend (unsigned int)

     unsigned int __builtin_tabort (unsigned int)
     unsigned int __builtin_tabortdc (unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned int)
     unsigned int __builtin_tabortdci (unsigned int, unsigned int, int)
     unsigned int __builtin_tabortwc (unsigned int, unsigned int, unsigned int)
     unsigned int __builtin_tabortwci (unsigned int, unsigned int, int)

     unsigned int __builtin_tcheck (unsigned int)
     unsigned int __builtin_treclaim (unsigned int)
     unsigned int __builtin_trechkpt (void)
     unsigned int __builtin_tsr (unsigned int)

 In addition to the above HTM built-ins, we have added built-ins for
some common extended mnemonics of the HTM instructions:

     unsigned int __builtin_tendall (void)
     unsigned int __builtin_tresume (void)
     unsigned int __builtin_tsuspend (void)

 The following set of built-in functions are available to gain access
to the HTM specific special purpose registers.

     unsigned long __builtin_get_texasr (void)
     unsigned long __builtin_get_texasru (void)
     unsigned long __builtin_get_tfhar (void)
     unsigned long __builtin_get_tfiar (void)

     void __builtin_set_texasr (unsigned long);
     void __builtin_set_texasru (unsigned long);
     void __builtin_set_tfhar (unsigned long);
     void __builtin_set_tfiar (unsigned long);

 Example usage of these low level built-in functions may look like:

     #include <htmintrin.h>

     int num_retries = 10;

     while (1)
       {
         if (__builtin_tbegin (0))
           {
             /* Transaction State Initiated.  */
             if (is_locked (lock))
               __builtin_tabort (0);
             ... transaction code...
             __builtin_tend (0);
             break;
           }
         else
           {
             /* Transaction State Failed.  Use locks if the transaction
                failure is "persistent" or we've tried too many times.  */
             if (num_retries-- <= 0
                 || _TEXASRU_FAILURE_PERSISTENT (__builtin_get_texasru ()))
               {
                 acquire_lock (lock);
                 ... non transactional fallback path...
                 release_lock (lock);
                 break;
               }
           }
       }

 One final built-in function has been added that returns the value of
the 2-bit Transaction State field of the Machine Status Register (MSR)
as stored in `CR0'.

     unsigned long __builtin_ttest (void)

 This built-in can be used to determine the current transaction state
using the following code example:

     #include <htmintrin.h>

     unsigned char tx_state = _HTM_STATE (__builtin_ttest ());

     if (tx_state == _HTM_TRANSACTIONAL)
       {
         /* Code to use in transactional state.  */
       }
     else if (tx_state == _HTM_NONTRANSACTIONAL)
       {
         /* Code to use in non-transactional state.  */
       }
     else if (tx_state == _HTM_SUSPENDED)
       {
         /* Code to use in transaction suspended state.  */
       }

6.58.21.2 PowerPC HTM High Level Inline Functions
.................................................

The following high level HTM interface is made available by including
`<htmxlintrin.h>' and using `-mhtm' or `-mcpu=CPU' where CPU is
`power8' or later.  This interface is common between PowerPC and S/390,
allowing users to write one HTM source implementation that can be
compiled and executed on either system.

 Using these common set of HTM inline functions, we can create a more
portable version of the HTM example in the previous section that will
work on either PowerPC or S/390:

     #include <htmxlintrin.h>

     int num_retries = 10;
     TM_buff_type TM_buff;

     while (1)

             /* Transaction State Initiated.  */
             if (is_locked (lock))
               __TM_abort ();
             ... transaction code...
             __TM_end ();
             break;
           }
         else
           {
             /* Transaction State Failed.  Use locks if the transaction
                failure is "persistent" or we've tried too many times.  */
             if (num_retries-- <= 0
                 || __TM_is_failure_persistent (TM_buff))
               {
                 acquire_lock (lock);
                 ... non transactional fallback path...
                 release_lock (lock);
                 break;
               }
           }
       }

6.58.23 S/390 System z Built-in Functions
-----------------------------------------

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_tbegin (void*)
     Generates the `tbegin' machine instruction starting a
     non-constraint hardware transaction.  If the parameter is non-NULL
     the memory area is used to store the transaction diagnostic buffer
     and will be passed as first operand to `tbegin'.  This buffer can
     be defined using the `struct __htm_tdb' C struct defined in
     `htmintrin.h' and must reside on a double-word boundary.  The
     second tbegin operand is set to `0xff0c'. This enables
     save/restore of all GPRs and disables aborts for FPR and AR
     manipulations inside the transaction body.  The condition code set
     by the tbegin instruction is returned as integer value.  The tbegin
     instruction by definition overwrites the content of all FPRs.  The
     compiler will generate code which saves and restores the FPRs.  For
     soft-float code it is recommended to used the `*_nofloat' variant.
     In order to prevent a TDB from being written it is required to
     pass an constant zero value as parameter.  Passing the zero value
     through a variable is not sufficient.  Although modifications of
     access registers inside the transaction will not trigger an
     transaction abort it is not supported to actually modify them.
     Access registers do not get saved when entering a transaction.
     They will have undefined state when reaching the abort code.

 Macros for the possible return codes of tbegin are defined in the
`htmintrin.h' header file:

`_HTM_TBEGIN_STARTED'
     `tbegin' has been executed as part of normal processing.  The
     transaction body is supposed to be executed.

`_HTM_TBEGIN_INDETERMINATE'
     The transaction was aborted due to an indeterminate condition which
     might be persistent.

`_HTM_TBEGIN_TRANSIENT'
     The transaction aborted due to a transient failure.  The
     transaction should be re-executed in that case.

`_HTM_TBEGIN_PERSISTENT'
     The transaction aborted due to a persistent failure.  Re-execution
     under same circumstances will not be productive.

 -- Macro: _HTM_FIRST_USER_ABORT_CODE
     The `_HTM_FIRST_USER_ABORT_CODE' defined in `htmintrin.h'
     specifies the first abort code which can be used for
     `__builtin_tabort'.  Values below this threshold are reserved for
     machine use.

 -- Data type: struct __htm_tdb
     The `struct __htm_tdb' defined in `htmintrin.h' describes the
     structure of the transaction diagnostic block as specified in the
     Principles of Operation manual chapter 5-91.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_tbegin_nofloat (void*)
     Same as `__builtin_tbegin' but without FPR saves and restores.
     Using this variant in code making use of FPRs will leave the FPRs
     in undefined state when entering the transaction abort handler
     code.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_tbegin_retry (void*, int)
     In addition to `__builtin_tbegin' a loop for transient failures is
     generated.  If tbegin returns a condition code of 2 the transaction
     will be retried as often as specified in the second argument.  The
     perform processor assist instruction is used to tell the CPU about
     the number of fails so far.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_tbegin_retry_nofloat (void*, int)
     Same as `__builtin_tbegin_retry' but without FPR saves and
     restores.  Using this variant in code making use of FPRs will leave
     the FPRs in undefined state when entering the transaction abort
     handler code.

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_tbeginc (void)
     Generates the `tbeginc' machine instruction starting a constraint
     hardware transaction.  The second operand is set to `0xff08'.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_tend (void)
     Generates the `tend' machine instruction finishing a transaction
     and making the changes visible to other threads.  The condition
     code generated by tend is returned as integer value.

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_tabort (int)
     Generates the `tabort' machine instruction with the specified
     abort code.  Abort codes from 0 through 255 are reserved and will
     result in an error message.

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_tx_assist (int)
     Generates the `ppa rX,rY,1' machine instruction.  Where the
     integer parameter is loaded into rX and a value of zero is loaded
     into rY.  The integer parameter specifies the number of times the
     transaction repeatedly aborted.

 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_tx_nesting_depth (void)
     Generates the `etnd' machine instruction.  The current nesting
     depth is returned as integer value.  For a nesting depth of 0 the
     code is not executed as part of an transaction.

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_non_tx_store (uint64_t *,
          uint64_t)
     Generates the `ntstg' machine instruction.  The second argument is
     written to the first arguments location.  The store operation will
     not be rolled-back in case of an transaction abort.

6.58.24 SH Built-in Functions
-----------------------------

The following built-in functions are supported on the SH1, SH2, SH3 and
SH4 families of processors:

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_set_thread_pointer (void *PTR)
     Sets the `GBR' register to the specified value PTR.  This is
     usually used by system code that manages threads and execution
     contexts.  The compiler normally does not generate code that
     modifies the contents of `GBR' and thus the value is preserved
     across function calls.  Changing the `GBR' value in user code must
     be done with caution, since the compiler might use `GBR' in order
     to access thread local variables.


 -- Built-in Function: void * __builtin_thread_pointer (void)
     Returns the value that is currently set in the `GBR' register.
     Memory loads and stores that use the thread pointer as a base
     address are turned into `GBR' based displacement loads and stores,
     if possible.  For example:
          struct my_tcb
          {
             int a, b, c, d, e;
          };

          int get_tcb_value (void)
          {
            // Generate `mov.l @(8,gbr),r0' instruction
            return ((my_tcb*)__builtin_thread_pointer ())->c;
          }

 -- Built-in Function: unsigned int __builtin_sh_get_fpscr (void)
     Returns the value that is currently set in the `FPSCR' register.

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_sh_set_fpscr (unsigned int VAL)
     Sets the `FPSCR' register to the specified value VAL, while
     preserving the current values of the FR, SZ and PR bits.

6.58.26 SPU Built-in Functions
------------------------------

GCC provides extensions for the SPU processor as described in the
Sony/Toshiba/IBM SPU Language Extensions Specification, which can be
found at `http://cell.scei.co.jp/' or
`http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/power/cell/'.  GCC's implementation
differs in several ways.

   * The optional extension of specifying vector constants in
     parentheses is not supported.

   * A vector initializer requires no cast if the vector constant is of
     the same type as the variable it is initializing.

   * If `signed' or `unsigned' is omitted, the signedness of the vector
     type is the default signedness of the base type.  The default
     varies depending on the operating system, so a portable program
     should always specify the signedness.

   * By default, the keyword `__vector' is added. The macro `vector' is
     defined in `<spu_intrinsics.h>' and can be undefined.

   * GCC allows using a `typedef' name as the type specifier for a
     vector type.

   * For C, overloaded functions are implemented with macros so the
     following does not work:

            spu_add ((vector signed int){1, 2, 3, 4}, foo);

     Since `spu_add' is a macro, the vector constant in the example is
     treated as four separate arguments.  Wrap the entire argument in
     parentheses for this to work.

   * The extended version of `__builtin_expect' is not supported.


 _Note:_ Only the interface described in the aforementioned
specification is supported. Internally, GCC uses built-in functions to
implement the required functionality, but these are not supported and
are subject to change without notice.

6.58.29 TILEPro Built-in Functions
----------------------------------

GCC provides intrinsics to access every instruction of the TILEPro
processor.  The intrinsics are of the form:


     unsigned __insn_OP (...)

where OP is the name of the instruction.  Refer to the ISA manual for
the complete list of instructions.

 GCC also provides intrinsics to directly access the network registers.
The intrinsics are:


     unsigned __tile_idn0_receive (void)
     unsigned __tile_idn1_receive (void)
     unsigned __tile_sn_receive (void)

6.58.30 x86 Built-in Functions
------------------------------

These built-in functions are available for the x86-32 and x86-64 family
of computers, depending on the command-line switches used.

 If you specify command-line switches such as `-msse', the compiler
could use the extended instruction sets even if the built-ins are not
used explicitly in the program.  For this reason, applications that
perform run-time CPU detection must compile separate files for each
supported architecture, using the appropriate flags.  In particular,
the file containing the CPU detection code should be compiled without
these options.

 The following machine modes are available for use with MMX built-in
functions (*note Vector Extensions::): `V2SI' for a vector of two
32-bit integers, `V4HI' for a vector of four 16-bit integers, and
`V8QI' for a vector of eight 8-bit integers.  Some of the built-in
functions operate on MMX registers as a whole 64-bit entity, these use
`V1DI' as their mode.

 If 3DNow! extensions are enabled, `V2SF' is used as a mode for a vector
of two 32-bit floating-point values.

 If SSE extensions are enabled, `V4SF' is used for a vector of four
32-bit floating-point values.  Some instructions use a vector of four
32-bit integers, these use `V4SI'.  Finally, some instructions operate
on an entire vector register, interpreting it as a 128-bit integer,
these use mode `TI'.

 In 64-bit mode, the x86-64 family of processors uses additional
built-in functions for efficient use of `TF' (`__float128') 128-bit
floating point and `TC' 128-bit complex floating-point values.

 The following floating-point built-in functions are available in 64-bit
mode.  All of them implement the function that is part of the name.

     __float128 __builtin_fabsq (__float128)
     __float128 __builtin_copysignq (__float128, __float128)

 The following built-in function is always available.

`void __builtin_ia32_pause (void)'
     Generates the `pause' machine instruction with a compiler memory
     barrier.

 The following floating-point built-in functions are made available in
the 64-bit mode.

`__float128 __builtin_infq (void)'
     Similar to `__builtin_inf', except the return type is `__float128'.  

`__float128 __builtin_huge_valq (void)'
     Similar to `__builtin_huge_val', except the return type is
     `__float128'.  

 The following built-in functions are always available and can be used
to check the target platform type.

 -- Built-in Function: void __builtin_cpu_init (void)
     This function runs the CPU detection code to check the type of CPU
     and the features supported.  This built-in function needs to be
     invoked along with the built-in functions to check CPU type and
     features, `__builtin_cpu_is' and `__builtin_cpu_supports', only
     when used in a function that is executed before any constructors
     are called.  The CPU detection code is automatically executed in a
     very high priority constructor.

     For example, this function has to be used in `ifunc' resolvers that
     check for CPU type using the built-in functions `__builtin_cpu_is'
     and `__builtin_cpu_supports', or in constructors on targets that
     don't support constructor priority.

          static void (*resolve_memcpy (void)) (void)
          {
            // ifunc resolvers fire before constructors, explicitly call the init
            // function.
            __builtin_cpu_init ();
            if (__builtin_cpu_supports ("ssse3"))
              return ssse3_memcpy; // super fast memcpy with ssse3 instructions.
            else
              return default_memcpy;
          }

          void *memcpy (void *, const void *, size_t)
               __attribute__ ((ifunc ("resolve_memcpy")));


 -- Built-in Function: int __builtin_cpu_is (const char *CPUNAME)

     type CPUNAME and returns `0' otherwise. The following CPU names
     can be detected:

               do_corei7 (); // Core i7 specific implementation.
            }
          else
            {

            }
          else

They are used for restricted transactional memory. These are the
internal low level functions. Normally the functions in *note x86
transactional memory intrinsics:: should be used instead.

     int __builtin_ia32_xbegin ()
     void __builtin_ia32_xend ()
     void __builtin_ia32_xabort (status)
     int __builtin_ia32_xtest ()

6.58.31 x86 Transactional Memory Intrinsics
-------------------------------------------

These hardware transactional memory intrinsics for x86 allow you to use
memory transactions with RTM (Restricted Transactional Memory).  This
support is enabled with the `-mrtm' option.  For using HLE (Hardware
Lock Elision) see *note x86 specific memory model extensions for
transactional memory:: instead.

 A memory transaction commits all changes to memory in an atomic way,
as visible to other threads. If the transaction fails it is rolled back
and all side effects discarded.

 Generally there is no guarantee that a memory transaction ever succeeds
and suitable fallback code always needs to be supplied.

 -- RTM Function: unsigned _xbegin ()
     Start a RTM (Restricted Transactional Memory) transaction.
     Returns `_XBEGIN_STARTED' when the transaction started
     successfully (note this is not 0, so the constant has to be
     explicitly tested).

     If the transaction aborts, all side-effects are undone and an
     abort code encoded as a bit mask is returned.  The following
     macros are defined:

    `_XABORT_EXPLICIT'
          Transaction was explicitly aborted with `_xabort'.  The
          parameter passed to `_xabort' is available with
          `_XABORT_CODE(status)'.

    `_XABORT_RETRY'
          Transaction retry is possible.

    `_XABORT_CONFLICT'
          Transaction abort due to a memory conflict with another
          thread.

    `_XABORT_CAPACITY'
          Transaction abort due to the transaction using too much
          memory.

    `_XABORT_DEBUG'
          Transaction abort due to a debug trap.

    `_XABORT_NESTED'
          Transaction abort in an inner nested transaction.

     There is no guarantee any transaction ever succeeds, so there
     always needs to be a valid fallback path.

 -- RTM Function: void _xend ()
     Commit the current transaction. When no transaction is active this
     faults.  All memory side-effects of the transaction become visible
     to other threads in an atomic manner.

 -- RTM Function: int _xtest ()
     Return a nonzero value if a transaction is currently active,
     otherwise 0.

 -- RTM Function: void _xabort (status)
     Abort the current transaction. When no transaction is active this
     is a no-op.  The STATUS is an 8-bit constant; its value is encoded
     in the return value from `_xbegin'.

 Here is an example showing handling for `_XABORT_RETRY' and a fallback
path for other failures:

     #include <immintrin.h>

     int n_tries, max_tries;
     unsigned status = _XABORT_EXPLICIT;
     ...

     for (n_tries = 0; n_tries < max_tries; n_tries++)
       {
         status = _xbegin ();
         if (status == _XBEGIN_STARTED || !(status & _XABORT_RETRY))
           break;
       }
     if (status == _XBEGIN_STARTED)
       {
         ... transaction code...
         _xend ();
       }
     else
       {
         ... non-transactional fallback path...
       }

Note that, in most cases, the transactional and non-transactional code
must synchronize together to ensure consistency.

6.59 Format Checks Specific to Particular Target Machines
=========================================================

For some target machines, GCC supports additional options to the format
attribute (*note Declaring Attributes of Functions: Function
Attributes.).

* Menu:

* Solaris Format Checks::
* Darwin Format Checks::


File: llvm.info,  Node: Solaris Format Checks,  Next: Darwin Format Checks,  Up: Target Format Checks

6.59.1 Solaris Format Checks
----------------------------

Solaris targets support the `cmn_err' (or `__cmn_err__') format check.
`cmn_err' accepts a subset of the standard `printf' conversions, and
the two-argument `%b' conversion for displaying bit-fields.  See the
Solaris man page for `cmn_err' for more information.


File: llvm.info,  Node: Darwin Format Checks,  Prev: Solaris Format Checks,  Up: Target Format Checks

6.59.2 Darwin Format Checks
---------------------------

Darwin targets support the `CFString' (or `__CFString__') in the format
attribute context.  Declarations made with such attribution are parsed
for correct syntax and format argument types.  However, parsing of the
format string itself is currently undefined and is not carried out by
this version of the compiler.

 Additionally, `CFStringRefs' (defined by the `CoreFoundation' headers)
may also be used as format arguments.  Note that the relevant headers
are only likely to be available on Darwin (OSX) installations.  On such
installations, the XCode and system documentation provide descriptions
of `CFString', `CFStringRefs' and associated functions.

6.60 Pragmas Accepted by GCC
============================

GCC supports several types of pragmas, primarily in order to compile
code originally written for other compilers.  Note that in general we
do not recommend the use of pragmas; *Note Function Attributes::, for
further explanation.

* Menu:

* ARM Pragmas::
* M32C Pragmas::

* Loop-Specific Pragmas::


File: llvm.info,  Node: ARM Pragmas,  Next: M32C Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

6.60.1 ARM Pragmas
------------------

The ARM target defines pragmas for controlling the default addition of
`long_call' and `short_call' attributes to functions.  *Note Function
Attributes::, for information about the effects of these attributes.

`long_calls'
     Set all subsequent functions to have the `long_call' attribute.

`no_long_calls'
     Set all subsequent functions to have the `short_call' attribute.

`long_calls_off'
     Do not affect the `long_call' or `short_call' attributes of
     subsequent functions.


File: llvm.info,  Node: M32C Pragmas,  Next: MeP Pragmas,  Prev: ARM Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

6.60.2 M32C Pragmas
-------------------

`GCC memregs NUMBER'
     Overrides the command-line option `-memregs=' for the current
     file.  Use with care!  This pragma must be before any function in
     the file, and mixing different memregs values in different objects
     may make them incompatible.  This pragma is useful when a
     performance-critical function uses a memreg for temporary values,
     as it may allow you to reduce the number of memregs used.

`ADDRESS NAME ADDRESS'
     For any declared symbols matching NAME, this does three things to
     that symbol: it forces the symbol to be located at the given
     address (a number), it forces the symbol to be volatile, and it
     changes the symbol's scope to be static.  This pragma exists for
     compatibility with other compilers, but note that the common
     `1234H' numeric syntax is not supported (use `0x1234' instead).
     Example:

          #pragma ADDRESS port3 0x103
          char port3;



File: llvm.info,  Node: MeP Pragmas,  Next: RS/6000 and PowerPC Pragmas,  Prev: M32C Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

6.60.3 MeP Pragmas
------------------

`custom io_volatile (on|off)'
     Overrides the command-line option `-mio-volatile' for the current
     file.  Note that for compatibility with future GCC releases, this
     option should only be used once before any `io' variables in each
     file.

`GCC coprocessor available REGISTERS'
     Specifies which coprocessor registers are available to the register
     allocator.  REGISTERS may be a single register, register range
     separated by ellipses, or comma-separated list of those.  Example:

          #pragma GCC coprocessor available $c0...$c10, $c28

`GCC coprocessor call_saved REGISTERS'
     Specifies which coprocessor registers are to be saved and restored
     by any function using them.  REGISTERS may be a single register,
     register range separated by ellipses, or comma-separated list of
     those.  Example:

          #pragma GCC coprocessor call_saved $c4...$c6, $c31

`GCC coprocessor subclass '(A|B|C|D)' = REGISTERS'
     Creates and defines a register class.  These register classes can
     be used by inline `asm' constructs.  REGISTERS may be a single
     register, register range separated by ellipses, or comma-separated
     list of those.  Example:

          #pragma GCC coprocessor subclass 'B' = $c2, $c4, $c6

          asm ("cpfoo %0" : "=B" (x));

`GCC disinterrupt NAME , NAME ...'
     For the named functions, the compiler adds code to disable
     interrupts for the duration of those functions.  If any functions
     so named are not encountered in the source, a warning is emitted
     that the pragma is not used.  Examples:

          #pragma disinterrupt foo
          #pragma disinterrupt bar, grill
          int foo () { ... }

`GCC call NAME , NAME ...'
     For the named functions, the compiler always uses a
     register-indirect call model when calling the named functions.
     Examples:

          extern int foo ();
          #pragma call foo

6.60.4 RS/6000 and PowerPC Pragmas
----------------------------------

The RS/6000 and PowerPC targets define one pragma for controlling
whether or not the `longcall' attribute is added to function
declarations by default.  This pragma overrides the `-mlongcall'
option, but not the `longcall' and `shortcall' attributes.  *Note
RS/6000 and PowerPC Options::, for more information about when long
calls are and are not necessary.

`longcall (1)'
     Apply the `longcall' attribute to all subsequent function
     declarations.

`longcall (0)'
     Do not apply the `longcall' attribute to subsequent function
     declarations.

6.60.5 Darwin Pragmas
---------------------

The following pragmas are available for all architectures running the
Darwin operating system.  These are useful for compatibility with other
Mac OS compilers.

`mark TOKENS...'
     This pragma is accepted, but has no effect.

`options align=ALIGNMENT'
     This pragma sets the alignment of fields in structures.  The
     values of ALIGNMENT may be `mac68k', to emulate m68k alignment, or
     `power', to emulate PowerPC alignment.  Uses of this pragma nest
     properly; to restore the previous setting, use `reset' for the
     ALIGNMENT.

`segment TOKENS...'
     This pragma is accepted, but has no effect.

`unused (VAR [, VAR]...)'
     This pragma declares variables to be possibly unused.  GCC does not
     produce warnings for the listed variables.  The effect is similar
     to that of the `unused' attribute, except that this pragma may
     appear anywhere within the variables' scopes.


File: llvm.info,  Node: Solaris Pragmas,  Next: Symbol-Renaming Pragmas,  Prev: Darwin Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

6.60.6 Solaris Pragmas
----------------------

The Solaris target supports `#pragma redefine_extname' (*note
Symbol-Renaming Pragmas::).  It also supports additional `#pragma'
directives for compatibility with the system compiler.

`align ALIGNMENT (VARIABLE [, VARIABLE]...)'
     Increase the minimum alignment of each VARIABLE to ALIGNMENT.
     This is the same as GCC's `aligned' attribute *note Variable
     Attributes::).  Macro expansion occurs on the arguments to this
     pragma when compiling C and Objective-C.  It does not currently
     occur when compiling C++, but this is a bug which may be fixed in
     a future release.

`fini (FUNCTION [, FUNCTION]...)'
     This pragma causes each listed FUNCTION to be called after main,
     or during shared module unloading, by adding a call to the `.fini'
     section.

`init (FUNCTION [, FUNCTION]...)'
     This pragma causes each listed FUNCTION to be called during
     initialization (before `main') or during shared module loading, by
     adding a call to the `.init' section.



File: llvm.info,  Node: Symbol-Renaming Pragmas,  Next: Structure-Packing Pragmas,  Prev: Solaris Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

6.60.7 Symbol-Renaming Pragmas
------------------------------

GCC supports a `#pragma' directive that changes the name used in
assembly for a given declaration. While this pragma is supported on all
platforms, it is intended primarily to provide compatibility with the
Solaris system headers. This effect can also be achieved using the asm
labels extension (*note Asm Labels::).

`redefine_extname OLDNAME NEWNAME'
     This pragma gives the C function OLDNAME the assembly symbol
     NEWNAME.  The preprocessor macro `__PRAGMA_REDEFINE_EXTNAME' is
     defined if this pragma is available (currently on all platforms).

 This pragma and the asm labels extension interact in a complicated
manner.  Here are some corner cases you may want to be aware of:

  1. This pragma silently applies only to declarations with external
     linkage.  Asm labels do not have this restriction.

  2. In C++, this pragma silently applies only to declarations with "C"
     linkage.  Again, asm labels do not have this restriction.

  3. If either of the ways of changing the assembly name of a
     declaration are applied to a declaration whose assembly name has
     already been determined (either by a previous use of one of these
     features, or because the compiler needed the assembly name in
     order to generate code), and the new name is different, a warning
     issues and the name does not change.

  4. The OLDNAME used by `#pragma redefine_extname' is always the
     C-language name.


File: llvm.info,  Node: Structure-Packing Pragmas,  Next: Weak Pragmas,  Prev: Symbol-Renaming Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

6.60.8 Structure-Packing Pragmas
--------------------------------

For compatibility with Microsoft Windows compilers, GCC supports a set
of `#pragma' directives that change the maximum alignment of members of
structures (other than zero-width bit-fields), unions, and classes
subsequently defined. The N value below always is required to be a
small power of two and specifies the new alignment in bytes.

  1. `#pragma pack(N)' simply sets the new alignment.

  2. `#pragma pack()' sets the alignment to the one that was in effect
     when compilation started (see also command-line option
     `-fpack-struct[=N]' *note Code Gen Options::).

  3. `#pragma pack(push[,N])' pushes the current alignment setting on
     an internal stack and then optionally sets the new alignment.

  4. `#pragma pack(pop)' restores the alignment setting to the one
     saved at the top of the internal stack (and removes that stack
     entry).  Note that `#pragma pack([N])' does not influence this
     internal stack; thus it is possible to have `#pragma pack(push)'
     followed by multiple `#pragma pack(N)' instances and finalized by
     a single `#pragma pack(pop)'.

 Some targets, e.g. x86 and PowerPC, support the `ms_struct' `#pragma'
which lays out a structure as the documented `__attribute__
((ms_struct))'.
  1. `#pragma ms_struct on' turns on the layout for structures declared.

  2. `#pragma ms_struct off' turns off the layout for structures
     declared.

  3. `#pragma ms_struct reset' goes back to the default layout.

6.60.9 Weak Pragmas
-------------------

For compatibility with SVR4, GCC supports a set of `#pragma' directives
for declaring symbols to be weak, and defining weak aliases.

`#pragma weak SYMBOL'
     This pragma declares SYMBOL to be weak, as if the declaration had
     the attribute of the same name.  The pragma may appear before or
     after the declaration of SYMBOL.  It is not an error for SYMBOL to
     never be defined at all.

`#pragma weak SYMBOL1 = SYMBOL2'
     This pragma declares SYMBOL1 to be a weak alias of SYMBOL2.  It is
     an error if SYMBOL2 is not defined in the current translation unit.


File: llvm.info,  Node: Diagnostic Pragmas,  Next: Visibility Pragmas,  Prev: Weak Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

6.60.10 Diagnostic Pragmas
--------------------------

GCC allows the user to selectively enable or disable certain types of
diagnostics, and change the kind of the diagnostic.  For example, a
project's policy might require that all sources compile with `-Werror'
but certain files might have exceptions allowing specific types of
warnings.  Or, a project might selectively enable diagnostics and treat
them as errors depending on which preprocessor macros are defined.

`#pragma GCC diagnostic KIND OPTION'
     Modifies the disposition of a diagnostic.  Note that not all
     diagnostics are modifiable; at the moment only warnings (normally
     controlled by `-W...') can be controlled, and not all of them.
     Use `-fdiagnostics-show-option' to determine which diagnostics are
     controllable and which option controls them.

     KIND is `error' to treat this diagnostic as an error, `warning' to
     treat it like a warning (even if `-Werror' is in effect), or
     `ignored' if the diagnostic is to be ignored.  OPTION is a double
     quoted string that matches the command-line option.

          #pragma GCC diagnostic warning "-Wformat"
          #pragma GCC diagnostic error "-Wformat"
          #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wformat"

     Note that these pragmas override any command-line options.  GCC
     keeps track of the location of each pragma, and issues diagnostics
     according to the state as of that point in the source file.  Thus,
     pragmas occurring after a line do not affect diagnostics caused by
     that line.

`#pragma GCC diagnostic push'
`#pragma GCC diagnostic pop'
     Causes GCC to remember the state of the diagnostics as of each
     `push', and restore to that point at each `pop'.  If a `pop' has
     no matching `push', the command-line options are restored.

          #pragma GCC diagnostic error "-Wuninitialized"
            foo(a);                       /* error is given for this one */
          #pragma GCC diagnostic push
          #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wuninitialized"
            foo(b);                       /* no diagnostic for this one */
          #pragma GCC diagnostic pop
            foo(c);                       /* error is given for this one */
          #pragma GCC diagnostic pop
            foo(d);                       /* depends on command-line options */


 GCC also offers a simple mechanism for printing messages during
compilation.

`#pragma message STRING'
     Prints STRING as a compiler message on compilation.  The message
     is informational only, and is neither a compilation warning nor an
     error.

          #pragma message "Compiling " __FILE__ "..."

     STRING may be parenthesized, and is printed with location
     information.  For example,

          #define DO_PRAGMA(x) _Pragma (#x)
          #define TODO(x) DO_PRAGMA(message ("TODO - " #x))

          TODO(Remember to fix this)

     prints `/tmp/file.c:4: note: #pragma message: TODO - Remember to
     fix this'.

6.60.11 Visibility Pragmas
--------------------------

`#pragma GCC visibility push(VISIBILITY)'
`#pragma GCC visibility pop'
     This pragma allows the user to set the visibility for multiple
     declarations without having to give each a visibility attribute
     (*note Function Attributes::).

     In C++, `#pragma GCC visibility' affects only namespace-scope
     declarations.  Class members and template specializations are not
     affected; if you want to override the visibility for a particular
     member or instantiation, you must use an attribute.



File: llvm.info,  Node: Push/Pop Macro Pragmas,  Next: Function Specific Option Pragmas,  Prev: Visibility Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

6.60.12 Push/Pop Macro Pragmas
------------------------------

For compatibility with Microsoft Windows compilers, GCC supports
`#pragma push_macro("MACRO_NAME")' and `#pragma
pop_macro("MACRO_NAME")'.

`#pragma push_macro("MACRO_NAME")'
     This pragma saves the value of the macro named as MACRO_NAME to
     the top of the stack for this macro.

`#pragma pop_macro("MACRO_NAME")'
     This pragma sets the value of the macro named as MACRO_NAME to the
     value on top of the stack for this macro. If the stack for
     MACRO_NAME is empty, the value of the macro remains unchanged.

 For example:

     #define X  1
     #pragma push_macro("X")
     #undef X
     #define X -1
     #pragma pop_macro("X")
     int x [X];

In this example, the definition of X as 1 is saved by `#pragma
push_macro' and restored by `#pragma pop_macro'.

6.60.13 Function Specific Option Pragmas
----------------------------------------

`#pragma GCC target ("STRING"...)'
     This pragma allows you to set target specific options for functions
     defined later in the source file.  One or more strings can be
     specified.  Each function that is defined after this point is as
     if `attribute((target("STRING")))' was specified for that
     function.  The parenthesis around the options is optional.  *Note
     Function Attributes::, for more information about the `target'
     attribute and the attribute syntax.

     The `#pragma GCC target' pragma is presently implemented for x86,
     PowerPC, and Nios II targets only.

`#pragma GCC optimize ("STRING"...)'
     This pragma allows you to set global optimization options for
     functions defined later in the source file.  One or more strings
     can be specified.  Each function that is defined after this point
     is as if `attribute((optimize("STRING")))' was specified for that
     function.  The parenthesis around the options is optional.  *Note
     Function Attributes::, for more information about the `optimize'
     attribute and the attribute syntax.

`#pragma GCC push_options'
`#pragma GCC pop_options'
     These pragmas maintain a stack of the current target and
     optimization options.  It is intended for include files where you
     temporarily want to switch to using a different `#pragma GCC
     target' or `#pragma GCC optimize' and then to pop back to the
     previous options.

`#pragma GCC reset_options'
     This pragma clears the current `#pragma GCC target' and `#pragma
     GCC optimize' to use the default switches as specified on the
     command line.


File: llvm.info,  Node: Loop-Specific Pragmas,  Prev: Function Specific Option Pragmas,  Up: Pragmas

6.60.14 Loop-Specific Pragmas
-----------------------------

`#pragma GCC ivdep'

 With this pragma, the programmer asserts that there are no loop-carried
dependencies which would prevent consecutive iterations of the
following loop from executing concurrently with SIMD (single
instruction multiple data) instructions.

 For example, the compiler can only unconditionally vectorize the
following loop with the pragma:

     void foo (int n, int *a, int *b, int *c)
     {
       int i, j;
     #pragma GCC ivdep
       for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
         a[i] = b[i] + c[i];
     }

In this example, using the `restrict' qualifier had the same effect. In
the following example, that would not be possible. Assume k < -m or k
>= m. Only with the pragma, the compiler knows that it can
unconditionally vectorize the following loop:

     void ignore_vec_dep (int *a, int k, int c, int m)
     {
     #pragma GCC ivdep
       for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
         a[i] = a[i + k] * c;
     }


File: llvm.info,  Node: Unnamed Fields,  Next: Thread-Local,  Prev: Pragmas,  Up: C Extensions

6.61 Unnamed Structure and Union Fields
=======================================

As permitted by ISO C11 and for compatibility with other compilers, GCC
allows you to define a structure or union that contains, as fields,
structures and unions without names.  For example:

     struct {
       int a;
       union {
         int b;
         float c;
       };
       int d;
     } foo;

In this example, you are able to access members of the unnamed union
with code like `foo.b'.  Note that only unnamed structs and unions are
allowed, you may not have, for example, an unnamed `int'.

 You must never create such structures that cause ambiguous field
definitions.  For example, in this structure:

     struct {
       int a;
       struct {
         int a;
       };
     } foo;

it is ambiguous which `a' is being referred to with `foo.a'.  The
compiler gives errors for such constructs.

 Unless `-fms-extensions' is used, the unnamed field must be a
structure or union definition without a tag (for example, `struct { int
a; };').  If `-fms-extensions' is used, the field may also be a
definition with a tag such as `struct foo { int a; };', a reference to
a previously defined structure or union such as `struct foo;', or a
reference to a `typedef' name for a previously defined structure or
union type.

 The option `-fplan9-extensions' enables `-fms-extensions' as well as
two other extensions.  First, a pointer to a structure is automatically
converted to a pointer to an anonymous field for assignments and
function calls.  For example:

     struct s1 { int a; };
     struct s2 { struct s1; };
     extern void f1 (struct s1 *);
     void f2 (struct s2 *p) { f1 (p); }

In the call to `f1' inside `f2', the pointer `p' is converted into a
pointer to the anonymous field.

 Second, when the type of an anonymous field is a `typedef' for a
`struct' or `union', code may refer to the field using the name of the
`typedef'.

     typedef struct { int a; } s1;
     struct s2 { s1; };
     s1 f1 (struct s2 *p) { return p->s1; }

 These usages are only permitted when they are not ambiguous.

6.62 Thread-Local Storage
=========================

Thread-local storage (TLS) is a mechanism by which variables are
allocated such that there is one instance of the variable per extant
thread.  The runtime model GCC uses to implement this originates in the
IA-64 processor-specific ABI, but has since been migrated to other
processors as well.  It requires significant support from the linker
(`ld'), dynamic linker (`ld.so'), and system libraries (`libc.so' and
`libpthread.so'), so it is not available everywhere.

 At the user level, the extension is visible with a new storage class
keyword: `__thread'.  For example:

     __thread int i;
     extern __thread struct state s;
     static __thread char *p;

 The `__thread' specifier may be used alone, with the `extern' or
`static' specifiers, but with no other storage class specifier.  When
used with `extern' or `static', `__thread' must appear immediately
after the other storage class specifier.

 The `__thread' specifier may be applied to any global, file-scoped
static, function-scoped static, or static data member of a class.  It
may not be applied to block-scoped automatic or non-static data member.

 When the address-of operator is applied to a thread-local variable, it
is evaluated at run time and returns the address of the current thread's
instance of that variable.  An address so obtained may be used by any
thread.  When a thread terminates, any pointers to thread-local
variables in that thread become invalid.

 No static initialization may refer to the address of a thread-local
variable.

 In C++, if an initializer is present for a thread-local variable, it
must be a CONSTANT-EXPRESSION, as defined in 5.19.2 of the ANSI/ISO C++
standard.

 See ELF Handling For Thread-Local Storage
(http://www.akkadia.org/drepper/tls.pdf) for a detailed explanation of
the four thread-local storage addressing models, and how the runtime is
expected to function.

-------------------------------------------------------

The following are a set of changes to ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (aka C99) that
document the exact semantics of the language extension.

   * `5.1.2  Execution environments'

     Add new text after paragraph 1

          Within either execution environment, a "thread" is a flow of
          control within a program.  It is implementation defined
          whether or not there may be more than one thread associated
          with a program.  It is implementation defined how threads
          beyond the first are created, the name and type of the
          function called at thread startup, and how threads may be
          terminated.  However, objects with thread storage duration
          shall be initialized before thread startup.

   * `6.2.4  Storage durations of objects'

     Add new text before paragraph 3

          An object whose identifier is declared with the storage-class
          specifier `__thread' has "thread storage duration".  Its
          lifetime is the entire execution of the thread, and its
          stored value is initialized only once, prior to thread
          startup.

   * `6.4.1  Keywords'

     Add `__thread'.

   * `6.7.1  Storage-class specifiers'

     Add `__thread' to the list of storage class specifiers in
     paragraph 1.

     Change paragraph 2 to

          With the exception of `__thread', at most one storage-class
          specifier may be given [...].  The `__thread' specifier may
          be used alone, or immediately following `extern' or `static'.

     Add new text after paragraph 6

          The declaration of an identifier for a variable that has
          block scope that specifies `__thread' shall also specify
          either `extern' or `static'.

          The `__thread' specifier shall be used only with variables.

--------------------------------------------------------

The following are a set of changes to ISO/IEC 14882:1998 (aka C++98)
that document the exact semantics of the language extension.

   * [intro.execution]

     New text after paragraph 4

          A "thread" is a flow of control within the abstract machine.
          It is implementation defined whether or not there may be more
          than one thread.

     New text after paragraph 7

          It is unspecified whether additional action must be taken to
          ensure when and whether side effects are visible to other
          threads.

   * [lex.key]

     Add `__thread'.

   * [basic.start.main]

     Add after paragraph 5

          The thread that begins execution at the `main' function is
          called the "main thread".  It is implementation defined how
          functions beginning threads other than the main thread are
          designated or typed.  A function so designated, as well as
          the `main' function, is called a "thread startup function".
          It is implementation defined what happens if a thread startup
          function returns.  It is implementation defined what happens
          to other threads when any thread calls `exit'.

   * [basic.start.init]

     Add after paragraph 4

          The storage for an object of thread storage duration shall be
          statically initialized before the first statement of the
          thread startup function.  An object of thread storage
          duration shall not require dynamic initialization.

   * [basic.start.term]

     Add after paragraph 3

          The type of an object with thread storage duration shall not
          have a non-trivial destructor, nor shall it be an array type
          whose elements (directly or indirectly) have non-trivial
          destructors.

   * [basic.stc]

     Add "thread storage duration" to the list in paragraph 1.

     Change paragraph 2

          Thread, static, and automatic storage durations are
          associated with objects introduced by declarations [...].

     Add `__thread' to the list of specifiers in paragraph 3.

   * [basic.stc.thread]

     New section before [basic.stc.static]

          The keyword `__thread' applied to a non-local object gives the
          object thread storage duration.

          A local variable or class data member declared both `static'
          and `__thread' gives the variable or member thread storage
          duration.

   * [basic.stc.static]

     Change paragraph 1

          All objects that have neither thread storage duration, dynamic
          storage duration nor are local [...].

   * [dcl.stc]

     Add `__thread' to the list in paragraph 1.

     Change paragraph 1

          With the exception of `__thread', at most one
          STORAGE-CLASS-SPECIFIER shall appear in a given
          DECL-SPECIFIER-SEQ.  The `__thread' specifier may be used
          alone, or immediately following the `extern' or `static'
          specifiers.  [...]

     Add after paragraph 5

          The `__thread' specifier can be applied only to the names of
          objects and to anonymous unions.

   * [class.mem]

     Add after paragraph 6

          Non-`static' members shall not be `__thread'.

6.63 Binary Constants using the `0b' Prefix
===========================================

Integer constants can be written as binary constants, consisting of a
sequence of `0' and `1' digits, prefixed by `0b' or `0B'.  This is
particularly useful in environments that operate a lot on the bit level
(like microcontrollers).

 The following statements are identical:

     i =       42;
     i =     0x2a;
     i =      052;
     i = 0b101010;

 The type of these constants follows the same rules as for octal or
hexadecimal integer constants, so suffixes like `L' or `UL' can be
applied.

7.1 When is a Volatile C++ Object Accessed?
===========================================

The C++ standard differs from the C standard in its treatment of
volatile objects.  It fails to specify what constitutes a volatile
access, except to say that C++ should behave in a similar manner to C
with respect to volatiles, where possible.  However, the different
lvalueness of expressions between C and C++ complicate the behavior.
G++ behaves the same as GCC for volatile access, *Note Volatiles: C
Extensions, for a description of GCC's behavior.

 The C and C++ language specifications differ when an object is
accessed in a void context:

     volatile int *src = SOMEVALUE;
     *src;

 The C++ standard specifies that such expressions do not undergo lvalue
to rvalue conversion, and that the type of the dereferenced object may
be incomplete.  The C++ standard does not specify explicitly that it is
lvalue to rvalue conversion that is responsible for causing an access.
There is reason to believe that it is, because otherwise certain simple
expressions become undefined.  However, because it would surprise most
programmers, G++ treats dereferencing a pointer to volatile object of
complete type as GCC would do for an equivalent type in C.  When the
object has incomplete type, G++ issues a warning; if you wish to force
an error, you must force a conversion to rvalue with, for instance, a
static cast.

 When using a reference to volatile, G++ does not treat equivalent
expressions as accesses to volatiles, but instead issues a warning that
no volatile is accessed.  The rationale for this is that otherwise it
becomes difficult to determine where volatile access occur, and not
possible to ignore the return value from functions returning volatile
references.  Again, if you wish to force a read, cast the reference to
an rvalue.

 G++ implements the same behavior as GCC does when assigning to a
volatile object--there is no reread of the assigned-to object, the
assigned rvalue is reused.  Note that in C++ assignment expressions are
lvalues, and if used as an lvalue, the volatile object is referred to.
For instance, VREF refers to VOBJ, as expected, in the following
example:

     volatile int vobj;
     volatile int &vref = vobj = SOMETHING;


File: llvm.info,  Node: Restricted Pointers,  Next: Vague Linkage,  Prev: C++ Volatiles,  Up: C++ Extensions

7.2 Restricting Pointer Aliasing
================================

As with the C front end, G++ understands the C99 feature of restricted
pointers, specified with the `__restrict__', or `__restrict' type
qualifier.  Because you cannot compile C++ by specifying the `-std=c99'
language flag, `restrict' is not a keyword in C++.

 In addition to allowing restricted pointers, you can specify restricted
references, which indicate that the reference is not aliased in the
local context.

     void fn (int *__restrict__ rptr, int &__restrict__ rref)
     {
       /* ... */
     }

In the body of `fn', RPTR points to an unaliased integer and RREF
refers to a (different) unaliased integer.

 You may also specify whether a member function's THIS pointer is
unaliased by using `__restrict__' as a member function qualifier.

     void T::fn () __restrict__
     {
       /* ... */
     }

Within the body of `T::fn', THIS has the effective definition `T
*__restrict__ const this'.  Notice that the interpretation of a
`__restrict__' member function qualifier is different to that of
`const' or `volatile' qualifier, in that it is applied to the pointer
rather than the object.  This is consistent with other compilers that
implement restricted pointers.

 As with all outermost parameter qualifiers, `__restrict__' is ignored
in function definition matching.  This means you only need to specify
`__restrict__' in a function definition, rather than in a function
prototype as well.

7.3 Vague Linkage
=================

There are several constructs in C++ that require space in the object
file but are not clearly tied to a single translation unit.  We say that
these constructs have "vague linkage".  Typically such constructs are
emitted wherever they are needed, though sometimes we can be more
clever.

Inline Functions
     Inline functions are typically defined in a header file which can
     be included in many different compilations.  Hopefully they can
     usually be inlined, but sometimes an out-of-line copy is
     necessary, if the address of the function is taken or if inlining
     fails.  In general, we emit an out-of-line copy in all translation
     units where one is needed.  As an exception, we only emit inline
     virtual functions with the vtable, since it always requires a copy.

     Local static variables and string constants used in an inline
     function are also considered to have vague linkage, since they
     must be shared between all inlined and out-of-line instances of
     the function.

VTables
     C++ virtual functions are implemented in most compilers using a
     lookup table, known as a vtable.  The vtable contains pointers to
     the virtual functions provided by a class, and each object of the
     class contains a pointer to its vtable (or vtables, in some
     multiple-inheritance situations).  If the class declares any
     non-inline, non-pure virtual functions, the first one is chosen as
     the "key method" for the class, and the vtable is only emitted in
     the translation unit where the key method is defined.

     _Note:_ If the chosen key method is later defined as inline, the
     vtable is still emitted in every translation unit that defines it.
     Make sure that any inline virtuals are declared inline in the class
     body, even if they are not defined there.

`type_info' objects
     C++ requires information about types to be written out in order to
     implement `dynamic_cast', `typeid' and exception handling.  For
     polymorphic classes (classes with virtual functions), the
     `type_info' object is written out along with the vtable so that
     `dynamic_cast' can determine the dynamic type of a class object at
     run time.  For all other types, we write out the `type_info'
     object when it is used: when applying `typeid' to an expression,
     throwing an object, or referring to a type in a catch clause or
     exception specification.

Template Instantiations
     Most everything in this section also applies to template
     instantiations, but there are other options as well.  *Note
     Where's the Template?: Template Instantiation.


 When used with GNU ld version 2.8 or later on an ELF system such as
GNU/Linux or Solaris 2, or on Microsoft Windows, duplicate copies of
these constructs will be discarded at link time.  This is known as
COMDAT support.

 On targets that don't support COMDAT, but do support weak symbols, GCC
uses them.  This way one copy overrides all the others, but the unused
copies still take up space in the executable.

 For targets that do not support either COMDAT or weak symbols, most
entities with vague linkage are emitted as local symbols to avoid
duplicate definition errors from the linker.  This does not happen for
local statics in inlines, however, as having multiple copies almost
certainly breaks things.

 *Note Declarations and Definitions in One Header: C++ Interface, for
another way to control placement of these constructs.


File: llvm.info,  Node: C++ Interface,  Next: Template Instantiation,  Prev: Vague Linkage,  Up: C++ Extensions

7.4 C++ Interface and Implementation Pragmas
============================================

`#pragma interface' and `#pragma implementation' provide the user with
a way of explicitly directing the compiler to emit entities with vague
linkage (and debugging information) in a particular translation unit.

 _Note:_ These `#pragma's have been superceded as of GCC 2.7.2 by
COMDAT support and the "key method" heuristic mentioned in *note Vague
Linkage::.  Using them can actually cause your program to grow due to
unnecessary out-of-line copies of inline functions.

`#pragma interface'
`#pragma interface "SUBDIR/OBJECTS.h"'
     Use this directive in _header files_ that define object classes,
     to save space in most of the object files that use those classes.
     Normally, local copies of certain information (backup copies of
     inline member functions, debugging information, and the internal
     tables that implement virtual functions) must be kept in each
     object file that includes class definitions.  You can use this
     pragma to avoid such duplication.  When a header file containing
     `#pragma interface' is included in a compilation, this auxiliary
     information is not generated (unless the main input source file
     itself uses `#pragma implementation').  Instead, the object files
     contain references to be resolved at link time.

     The second form of this directive is useful for the case where you
     have multiple headers with the same name in different directories.
     If you use this form, you must specify the same string to `#pragma
     implementation'.

`#pragma implementation'
`#pragma implementation "OBJECTS.h"'
     Use this pragma in a _main input file_, when you want full output
     from included header files to be generated (and made globally
     visible).  The included header file, in turn, should use `#pragma
     interface'.  Backup copies of inline member functions, debugging
     information, and the internal tables used to implement virtual
     functions are all generated in implementation files.

     If you use `#pragma implementation' with no argument, it applies to
     an include file with the same basename(1) as your source file.
     For example, in `allclass.cc', giving just `#pragma implementation'
     by itself is equivalent to `#pragma implementation "allclass.h"'.

     Use the string argument if you want a single implementation file to
     include code from multiple header files.  (You must also use
     `#include' to include the header file; `#pragma implementation'
     only specifies how to use the file--it doesn't actually include
     it.)

     There is no way to split up the contents of a single header file
     into multiple implementation files.

 `#pragma implementation' and `#pragma interface' also have an effect
on function inlining.

 If you define a class in a header file marked with `#pragma
interface', the effect on an inline function defined in that class is
similar to an explicit `extern' declaration--the compiler emits no code
at all to define an independent version of the function.  Its
definition is used only for inlining with its callers.

 Conversely, when you include the same header file in a main source file
that declares it as `#pragma implementation', the compiler emits code
for the function itself; this defines a version of the function that
can be found via pointers (or by callers compiled without inlining).
If all calls to the function can be inlined, you can avoid emitting the
function by compiling with `-fno-implement-inlines'.  If any calls are
not inlined, you will get linker errors.

 (1) A file's "basename" is the name stripped of all leading path
information and of trailing suffixes, such as `.h' or `.C' or `.cc'.

7.5 Where's the Template?
=========================

C++ templates are the first language feature to require more
intelligence from the environment than one usually finds on a UNIX
system.  Somehow the compiler and linker have to make sure that each
template instance occurs exactly once in the executable if it is needed,
and not at all otherwise.  There are two basic approaches to this
problem, which are referred to as the Borland model and the Cfront
model.

Borland model
     Borland C++ solved the template instantiation problem by adding
     the code equivalent of common blocks to their linker; the compiler
     emits template instances in each translation unit that uses them,
     and the linker collapses them together.  The advantage of this
     model is that the linker only has to consider the object files
     themselves; there is no external complexity to worry about.  This
     disadvantage is that compilation time is increased because the
     template code is being compiled repeatedly.  Code written for this
     model tends to include definitions of all templates in the header
     file, since they must be seen to be instantiated.

Cfront model
     The AT&T C++ translator, Cfront, solved the template instantiation
     problem by creating the notion of a template repository, an
     automatically maintained place where template instances are
     stored.  A more modern version of the repository works as follows:
     As individual object files are built, the compiler places any
     template definitions and instantiations encountered in the
     repository.  At link time, the link wrapper adds in the objects in
     the repository and compiles any needed instances that were not
     previously emitted.  The advantages of this model are more optimal
     compilation speed and the ability to use the system linker; to
     implement the Borland model a compiler vendor also needs to
     replace the linker.  The disadvantages are vastly increased
     complexity, and thus potential for error; for some code this can be
     just as transparent, but in practice it can been very difficult to
     build multiple programs in one directory and one program in
     multiple directories.  Code written for this model tends to
     separate definitions of non-inline member templates into a
     separate file, which should be compiled separately.

 When used with GNU ld version 2.8 or later on an ELF system such as
GNU/Linux or Solaris 2, or on Microsoft Windows, G++ supports the
Borland model.  On other systems, G++ implements neither automatic
model.

 You have the following options for dealing with template
instantiations:

  1. Compile your template-using code with `-frepo'.  The compiler
     generates files with the extension `.rpo' listing all of the
     template instantiations used in the corresponding object files that
     could be instantiated there; the link wrapper, `collect2', then
     updates the `.rpo' files to tell the compiler where to place those
     instantiations and rebuild any affected object files.  The
     link-time overhead is negligible after the first pass, as the
     compiler continues to place the instantiations in the same files.

     This is your best option for application code written for the
     Borland model, as it just works.  Code written for the Cfront model
     needs to be modified so that the template definitions are
     available at one or more points of instantiation; usually this is
     as simple as adding `#include <tmethods.cc>' to the end of each
     template header.

     For library code, if you want the library to provide all of the
     template instantiations it needs, just try to link all of its
     object files together; the link will fail, but cause the
     instantiations to be generated as a side effect.  Be warned,
     however, that this may cause conflicts if multiple libraries try
     to provide the same instantiations.  For greater control, use
     explicit instantiation as described in the next option.

  2. Compile your code with `-fno-implicit-templates' to disable the
     implicit generation of template instances, and explicitly
     instantiate all the ones you use.  This approach requires more
     knowledge of exactly which instances you need than do the others,
     but it's less mysterious and allows greater control.  You can
     scatter the explicit instantiations throughout your program,
     perhaps putting them in the translation units where the instances
     are used or the translation units that define the templates
     themselves; you can put all of the explicit instantiations you
     need into one big file; or you can create small files like

          #include "Foo.h"
          #include "Foo.cc"

          template class Foo<int>;
          template ostream& operator <<
                          (ostream&, const Foo<int>&);

     for each of the instances you need, and create a template
     instantiation library from those.

     If you are using Cfront-model code, you can probably get away with
     not using `-fno-implicit-templates' when compiling files that don't
     `#include' the member template definitions.

     If you use one big file to do the instantiations, you may want to
     compile it without `-fno-implicit-templates' so you get all of the
     instances required by your explicit instantiations (but not by any
     other files) without having to specify them as well.

     The ISO C++ 2011 standard allows forward declaration of explicit
     instantiations (with `extern'). G++ supports explicit instantiation
     declarations in C++98 mode and has extended the template
     instantiation syntax to support instantiation of the compiler
     support data for a template class (i.e. the vtable) without
     instantiating any of its members (with `inline'), and
     instantiation of only the static data members of a template class,
     without the support data or member functions (with `static'):

          extern template int max (int, int);
          inline template class Foo<int>;
          static template class Foo<int>;

  3. Do nothing.  Pretend G++ does implement automatic instantiation
     management.  Code written for the Borland model works fine, but
     each translation unit contains instances of each of the templates
     it uses.  In a large program, this can lead to an unacceptable
     amount of code duplication.

7.6 Extracting the Function Pointer from a Bound Pointer to Member Function
===========================================================================

In C++, pointer to member functions (PMFs) are implemented using a wide
pointer of sorts to handle all the possible call mechanisms; the PMF
needs to store information about how to adjust the `this' pointer, and
if the function pointed to is virtual, where to find the vtable, and
where in the vtable to look for the member function.  If you are using
PMFs in an inner loop, you should really reconsider that decision.  If
that is not an option, you can extract the pointer to the function that
would be called for a given object/PMF pair and call it directly inside
the inner loop, to save a bit of time.

 Note that you still pay the penalty for the call through a function
pointer; on most modern architectures, such a call defeats the branch
prediction features of the CPU.  This is also true of normal virtual
function calls.

 The syntax for this extension is

     extern A a;
     extern int (A::*fp)();
     typedef int (*fptr)(A *);

     fptr p = (fptr)(a.*fp);

 For PMF constants (i.e. expressions of the form `&Klasse::Member'), no
object is needed to obtain the address of the function.  They can be
converted to function pointers directly:

     fptr p1 = (fptr)(&A::foo);

 You must specify `-Wno-pmf-conversions' to use this extension.

7.7 C++-Specific Variable, Function, and Type Attributes
========================================================

Some attributes only make sense for C++ programs.

`abi_tag ("TAG", ...)'
     The `abi_tag' attribute can be applied to a function or class
     declaration.  It modifies the mangled name of the function or
     class to incorporate the tag name, in order to distinguish the
     function or class from an earlier version with a different ABI;
     perhaps the class has changed size, or the function has a
     different return type that is not encoded in the mangled name.

     The argument can be a list of strings of arbitrary length.  The
     strings are sorted on output, so the order of the list is
     unimportant.

     A redeclaration of a function or class must not add new ABI tags,
     since doing so would change the mangled name.

     The ABI tags apply to a name, so all instantiations and
     specializations of a template have the same tags.  The attribute
     will be ignored if applied to an explicit specialization or
     instantiation.

     The `-Wabi-tag' flag enables a warning about a class which does
     not have all the ABI tags used by its subobjects and virtual
     functions; for users with code that needs to coexist with an
     earlier ABI, using this option can help to find all affected types
     that need to be tagged.

`init_priority (PRIORITY)'
     In Standard C++, objects defined at namespace scope are guaranteed
     to be initialized in an order in strict accordance with that of
     their definitions _in a given translation unit_.  No guarantee is
     made for initializations across translation units.  However, GNU
     C++ allows users to control the order of initialization of objects
     defined at namespace scope with the `init_priority' attribute by
     specifying a relative PRIORITY, a constant integral expression
     currently bounded between 101 and 65535 inclusive.  Lower numbers
     indicate a higher priority.

     In the following example, `A' would normally be created before
     `B', but the `init_priority' attribute reverses that order:

          Some_Class  A  __attribute__ ((init_priority (2000)));
          Some_Class  B  __attribute__ ((init_priority (543)));

     Note that the particular values of PRIORITY do not matter; only
     their relative ordering.

`java_interface'
     This type attribute informs C++ that the class is a Java
     interface.  It may only be applied to classes declared within an
     `extern "Java"' block.  Calls to methods declared in this
     interface are dispatched using GCJ's interface table mechanism,
     instead of regular virtual table dispatch.

`warn_unused'
     For C++ types with non-trivial constructors and/or destructors it
     is impossible for the compiler to determine whether a variable of
     this type is truly unused if it is not referenced. This type
     attribute informs the compiler that variables of this type should
     be warned about if they appear to be unused, just like variables
     of fundamental types.

     This attribute is appropriate for types which just represent a
     value, such as `std::string'; it is not appropriate for types which
     control a resource, such as `std::mutex'.

     This attribute is also accepted in C, but it is unnecessary
     because C does not have constructors or destructors.

7.8 Function Multiversioning
============================

With the GNU C++ front end, for x86 targets, you may specify multiple
versions of a function, where each function is specialized for a
specific target feature.  At runtime, the appropriate version of the
function is automatically executed depending on the characteristics of
the execution platform.  Here is an example.

     __attribute__ ((target ("default")))
     int foo ()
     {
       // The default version of foo.
       return 0;
     }

     __attribute__ ((target ("sse4.2")))
     int foo ()
     {
       // foo version for SSE4.2
       return 1;
     }

     __attribute__ ((target ("arch=atom")))
     int foo ()
     {
       // foo version for the Intel ATOM processor
       return 2;
     }

     __attribute__ ((target ("arch=amdfam10")))
     int foo ()
     {
       // foo version for the AMD Family 0x10 processors.
       return 3;
     }

     int main ()
     {
       int (*p)() = &foo;
       assert ((*p) () == foo ());
       return 0;
     }

 In the above example, four versions of function foo are created. The
first version of foo with the target attribute "default" is the default
version.  This version gets executed when no other target specific
version qualifies for execution on a particular platform. A new version
of foo is created by using the same function signature but with a
different target string.  Function foo is called or a pointer to it is
taken just like a regular function.  GCC takes care of doing the
dispatching to call the right version at runtime.  Refer to the GCC
wiki on Function Multiversioning
(http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/FunctionMultiVersioning) for more details.

7.9 Namespace Association
=========================

*Caution:* The semantics of this extension are equivalent to C++ 2011
inline namespaces.  Users should use inline namespaces instead as this
extension will be removed in future versions of G++.

 A using-directive with `__attribute ((strong))' is stronger than a
normal using-directive in two ways:

   * Templates from the used namespace can be specialized and explicitly
     instantiated as though they were members of the using namespace.

   * The using namespace is considered an associated namespace of all
     templates in the used namespace for purposes of argument-dependent
     name lookup.

 The used namespace must be nested within the using namespace so that
normal unqualified lookup works properly.

 This is useful for composing a namespace transparently from
implementation namespaces.  For example:

     namespace std {
       namespace debug {
         template <class T> struct A { };
       }
       using namespace debug __attribute ((__strong__));
       template <> struct A<int> { };   // OK to specialize

       template <class T> void f (A<T>);
     }

     int main()
     {
       f (std::A<float>());             // lookup finds std::f
       f (std::A<int>());
     }

7.11 Java Exceptions
====================

The Java language uses a slightly different exception handling model
from C++.  Normally, GNU C++ automatically detects when you are writing
C++ code that uses Java exceptions, and handle them appropriately.
However, if C++ code only needs to execute destructors when Java
exceptions are thrown through it, GCC guesses incorrectly.  Sample
problematic code is:

       struct S { ~S(); };
       extern void bar();    // is written in Java, and may throw exceptions
       void foo()
       {
         S s;
         bar();
       }

The usual effect of an incorrect guess is a link failure, complaining of
a missing routine called `__gxx_personality_v0'.

 You can inform the compiler that Java exceptions are to be used in a
translation unit, irrespective of what it might think, by writing
`#pragma GCC java_exceptions' at the head of the file.  This `#pragma'
must appear before any functions that throw or catch exceptions, or run
destructors when exceptions are thrown through them.

 You cannot mix Java and C++ exceptions in the same translation unit.
It is believed to be safe to throw a C++ exception from one file through
another file compiled for the Java exception model, or vice versa, but
there may be bugs in this area.
